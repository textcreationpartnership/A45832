         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Beleevers in Chriſt, eſpecially they who are in bondage to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath, and more particularly to thoſe in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> Grace and Peace be multiplyed from the God of Peace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F our Souls were but affected with the ſad and deplorable condition of the Churches of Chriſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe great diviſions that are among them, upon the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of every novel opinion, we ſhould take up the wiſh of the Prophet, and ſay, <hi>Oh that our head were waters, and our eyes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of tears!</hi> eſpecially if we conſider what great diſhonour it brings to God, who is and would be known to be a <hi>God of peace and not of confuſion</hi> in all the Churches of the Saints: and as God is diſhonoured, ſo the edification of the Churches are hindred; whilſt their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcords prove as great an obſtruction to their ſpiritual building, as the confuſion of Languages did to the building of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and as diſcord among Chriſtians hinders their
<pb facs="tcp:40990:3"/>edification, ſo it hinders the converſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for if a <hi>Jew</hi> or an Infidel come among Chriſtians, and obſerves the ſeveral Opinions that are among them, may they not have juſt cauſe to ſay, <hi>You are mad?</hi> Oh then! as you tender Gods honour and your own edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the worlds converſion, <hi>follow the things that make for peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order hereunto, let me give you ſome Cautions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That you be careful how you take up an opinion, or receive anything for truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have well weighed and conſidered of it. <hi>The fooliſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) beleeveth EVERY thing: but the prudent will conſider his ſteps,</hi> Prov. <hi>14.15.</hi> plainly ſhewing, that ſome are ſo fooliſh, that if they do but hear a thing, they will inconſiderately and raſhly receive it. Too much of this folly is at this time among profeſſors, who run to receive every new thing that they hear of, before they are able to give a Reaſon for the truth of the thing they ſo receive. Theſe men often prove troublers of the Churches peace; and turn the joy ſhe had of a ſudden Proſelite, into great ſorrow; &amp; that either by their unruly and diſorderly promoting their new received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, to the diſturbance of the peace, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
<pb facs="tcp:40990:3"/>of the growth of the Churches; or elſe by their ſudden departing from thoſe Notions, that they haſtily and inconſiderately received. For it is worth obſerving, that thoſe that haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbrace a thing (though it be truth) ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do remain permanent Profeſſors of it: this our Lord Chriſt teacheth us in the parable of the ſower, <hi>Mat. 13.5.</hi> compared with the <hi>20.</hi> where it is obſervable of the ſeed that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſtony ground, how that <hi>ANON it ſprung up, but it SUDDENLY withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red away for want of root:</hi> which Chriſt interprets to be for want of understanding, as appears, if you but compare this haſty Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor with the profeſſor who is ſaid to receive with <hi>underſtanding,</hi> ver. <hi>23.</hi> whereas the other is ſaid to receive it <hi>incontinently,</hi> ver. <hi>20.</hi> he departeth from it as ſuddenly, <hi>ver. 21.</hi> I ſpeak not this to the end that I might diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage people from hasting to keep Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but that, according to the Proverb, they ſhould <hi>make no more haſt then good ſpeed:</hi> for ſad experience tells us, that the Churches have ſped very ill by ſuch raſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate members, who have proved diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the peace, while they have been in; and many times have made havock of the Churches
<pb facs="tcp:40990:4"/>peace in their going out, by drawing others after them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As I would caution you to be careful in receiving, ſo I would likewiſe have you careful in the promoting any thing that you have ſo received.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, take heed of being too haſty in the venting that thou haſt newly received: for if once a man hath vented an opinion in publick, it will be hard to recant, though it prove very erronious: how ſad is it then to ſee men diſpute in publick for that to day, when they doubted of the truth of it but yeſterday!</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Be careful in promoting of any thing thou hast received paſſionately and uncharitably, branding all that differ from thee as Law-breakers and denyers of Scriptures, calling all Ranters, Quakers, Papiſts, Atheiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that deny the truth of thy opinion, as <hi>Mr. Tillam</hi> doth in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> pag. <hi>6.</hi> &amp; accuſers of Chriſt, and reproachers of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> pag. <hi>122, 123.</hi> again, he calls thoſe that do not agree with him in this point about the keeping of the ſeventh-day <hi>Sabbath,</hi> baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born muck-worms, <hi>pag. 26.</hi> But no wonder <hi>Mr. Tillam</hi> ſpeakes at this rate, ſince as he confeſſeth in his Book, <hi>That ſometimes his
<pb facs="tcp:40990:4"/>affection did out-run his judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe <hi>Mr. Spittlehouſe</hi> in his Book called, <hi>Error blaſted,</hi> wherein he uſeth a great many words in Capital Letters, inſtead of Capital Arguments; taking that for granted which he ought to have proved <hi>(viz.) Thát the Seventh-day Sabbath is a moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept:</hi> then having ſhamefully begged the Queſtion, he manfully infers, <hi>That all that are otherwiſe minded, are breakers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovahs Royal Law;</hi> when he himſelf (from that Text much inſiſted on by them, <hi>Mat. 5.17.</hi> to prove the <hi>Seventh-day Sabbath</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi>) faints in the way of his proof, by ſaying, <hi>It is PROBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE Chriſt preached that Sermon to the multitude, as well as to the twelve among whom there were Gentiles.</hi> But what if one ſhould ſay, It is certain that this was preached while the firſt <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was ſtanding? and that it is improbable that he preached to <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe preaching to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſeemed ſo ſtrange to <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts the <hi>10?</hi> might not a man have better ground to evince the one, then he hath to infer the other, <hi>(viz.)</hi> becauſe Chriſt preached to the multitude, that therefore two of the twelve were <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles?</hi> and yet for all he confeſſeth, that it is but
<pb facs="tcp:40990:5"/>a <hi>PROBABLE conjecture,</hi> yet he hath the confidence to imbark himſelf in a Paper Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, manned with great words, to incounter with all for Law-breakers, that are not <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day Sabbath-keepers.</hi> Comparing <hi>Mr. Ives</hi> who diſputed againſt his opinion, to <hi>a beaten Cock, that was ready to hide his head in any hole,</hi> pag. <hi>27.</hi> Which if he did, this enſuing account of the Diſputations will make appear.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let every one that reads <hi>Mr. Spittlchouſe</hi> his forementioned Book, ſee how he rather blasts himſelf then his erring Adverſary: for he goeth to prove againſt <hi>Mr. Ives, That the Sabbath ought to be kept by the Law of Nature,</hi> in his <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> pag. <hi>26.</hi> and yet in <hi>pag. 28.</hi> he cries out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mr. Ives,</hi> for that <hi>he went to diſprove the Morality of it by the light of Nature;</hi> comparing him to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that adhere <hi>to the light within them:</hi> you may ſee then how miſchievous a thing it is for a man paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to promote an opinion; it makes his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out-run his judgment, or elſe ſurely <hi>Mr. Spittlehouſe</hi> would not have taken Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of Natures Oracle to confute <hi>Mr. Ives</hi> (as he thought) and after decry Nature as
<pb facs="tcp:40990:5"/>corrupt, blaming <hi>Mr. Ives,</hi> for adhering to her dictates when he had laboured as in the fire, but <hi>two pages</hi> before, to prove <hi>the Law of Nature holy, juſt, and good:</hi> How much then doth it concern us to lay aſide paſſion in the promotion of that we conceive to be true, leſt we pull down that with one hand we ſet up with the other?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> In the promoting of thy Opinion, be more studious for Arguments then Rhetorical flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, which (together with railing Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) uſually ſupply the place of Arguments; a ſtrong ſign of a weak Cauſe. And of this <hi>Mr. Tillam</hi> is ſufficiently guilty: though at our Diſputation he decryed Syllogiſms, and refuſed to anſwer them; calling them <hi>the intiſing words of mans wiſdom,</hi> when his Book is full of ſuch kind of Humane wiſdom, almoſt in every <hi>page,</hi> where he Courts all the Liberal Sciences for terms of Art to garniſh his Book: as first, Grammatical terms, telling his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a <hi>Future Tenſe,</hi> and a <hi>Gerund</hi> in <hi>do,</hi> pag. <hi>15, 73.</hi> and as though he were writing an <hi>Almanack,</hi> he abounds with <hi>Aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Phraſes, as <hi>Meridian-Heights, the Suns Station</hi> &amp; <hi>Retrogradation, Meridian glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the <hi>celerity of the Sun when mounting the other Hemiſpere,</hi> the <hi>interpoſition of

            </p>
            <p>Again, He calls the contrary Opinion, <hi>A ſhadie Speculation,</hi> pag. <hi>8.</hi> Again, he is full of ſuch Phraſes as theſe, <hi>(viz.)

            <p>Let me beſeech you therefore, from what hath been ſaid, to ſuſpect thoſe men who are full of entiſing words, and empty of ſolid Arguments: and this is not only my advice, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's, who tells us, <hi>2 Pet. 2.

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Let me Caution thee to have a care not only how thou receiveſt an opinion, and how thou promoteſt it, but alſo how thou keepeſt and
<pb facs="tcp:40990:7"/>retaineſt it: if thou findest that it is truth thou haſt received, know, <hi>that her price is far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove rubies, and no pleaſure is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. <hi>8.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the Poet ſaw, when he elegantly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the eſtate of that man that had gained the knowledge of the Truth, ſaying, <hi>That it was a pleaſure to ſtand upon the ſhore and to ſee ſhips toſſed upon the Sea, and to ſtand in the window of a Caſtle to ſee a Battle and the adventures thereof below; but no pleaſure is comparable to the ſtanding upon the vantage ground of truth,</hi> (a hill not to be commanded, and where the Air is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways clear and ſerene) <hi>and to ſee the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and wrandrings, and miſts, and tempeſts in the vale below: provided that this proſpect be with pity, and not with ſwelling or pride.</hi> And as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith well, <hi>It is a Heaven upon Earth to have a mans minde move in Charity, reſt in Providence, and turn upon the Poles of Truth:</hi> Oh then! when you ſhall have received the truth as it is in Jeſus, walk in it, and be not eaſily perſwaded to move from the truth unto which thou art called, for any baſe or by-end whatever; and the God of truth
<pb facs="tcp:40990:8"/>ſhall at laſt recompence all thy Labours in it, and thy ſufferings for it.</p>
            <p>But is thou art convinced that ſome things whereof thou haſt been perſwaded are errors, be not aſhamed to confeſs thy mistakes; knowing, that it is ſo far from tending to thy ſhame, (whatever Satan or thy own heart ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee) that it will be a crown of glory and honour upon thy head, <hi>Prov. 4.8, 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in hold and contending for the Truth have a care leſt thou over-valuest or underva<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lueſt the truth thou makeſt profeſſion of, by counting thoſe Truths eſſential to ſalvation &amp; Church Communion, which are not ſo; or on the other hand by counting the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion, but circumſtantial things, and things without which a man may be ſaved: have a care then, lest thou by thy rigidneſs in things of leſs moment, ſhouldst diſturb the peace of the Church, and offend the Conſciences of thy weak Brethren for whom Christ died: the like care ought to be taken of the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of judging the Subſtantials of Religion as circumſtances, leſt by ſo doing we break down the whole Fabrick of the Christian Religion, and lay waſt the profeſſion thereof, by counting the props and ſtays of it as indifferent things.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40990:8"/>
            <p>Having cautioned you about the receiving, maintaining, and retaining of the truth, my deſire is, that you make uſe thereof in judging theſe inſuing Conferences about the <hi>ſeventh-day Sabbath,</hi> which I have carefully publiſhed for the ſtopping of ſlanderous mouths, who have miſrepreſented the Diſputations; and alſo for the ſatisfying them that doubt, and confirming of thoſe that are weak, that they be not carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines, and toſſed to and fro with every wind. If then by theſe threſhings there be any thing beat out (that lay hid before) by which thy ſoul may be ſtrengthened, and thy hungry deſire after truth ſatisfied, give God the glory; and if by the light hereof any darkneſs or weakneſs is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, bleſs the Father of lights; and if you do receive light, walk in it; that you may be found the children of it: and that this may be the end of our writing, and reading, praying, preaching, and diſputing, is the prayer and deſire of</p>

            <p>BEing by the Providence of God, and the intreaty of many of His People, put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this work, I hope I ſhall do nothing therein, of which I ſhall need to be aſhamed in my ſelf, or blamed by any that were hearers and impartial Judges of the enſuing Conferences, at the Bar of whoſe Tribunal I now ſtand: and for thoſe that are captious, and lie in wait for my halting, I ſhall appeal from the Bar of their partiality, to the Judge of all the World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this, I have not walked uprightly. And whereas there is ſomewhat added by way of Obſervation; both upon the Arguments and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, as occaſion is offered, I thought good to give notice, that whatever occurreth of this kind, I have put in a different Character, to avoid miſtakes that ſo the unwary or the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Reader might not confound what is added for further information, with what was offered in the Diſputation. And if thou findeſt a more methodical account of Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> his Arguments then Mr. <hi>Tillams,</hi> know, that Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to obſerve any Logical Method, either in this Arguings or Anſwers; and therefore what thou findeſt amiſs of this kind, do not impute to the partiality of the Scribe.</p>

               <p>If by ſtranger, you mean only the ſtranger that WAS within <hi>Iſraels</hi> Gates, then I deny the Major, becauſe the ſtranger within the gates was the Proſelyted ſtranger; and therefore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that becauſe the Proſelyted ſtrangers WERE commanded, that therefore the Gentiles that were not proſelyted, ARE under this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; which you are to prove, according to the fence explained in the queſtion.</p>
               <p>And if by ſtranger, you mean all ſtrangers, then I deny the Minor, and ſay, All ſtrangers ARE not commanded to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It might further be replyed, The ſtranger was commanded to be circumciſed,</hi> Gen. 17.12. And he that is eight dayes old, ſhall be circumciſed among you, every man-child in your generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is born in thy houſe, or is bought with thy money of ANY STRANGER that is not of thy ſeed. <hi>Doth it follow, becauſe that ſtrangers WERE to be circumciſed, that therefore they ARE to be circumciſed? and in like manner, it doth not follow that becauſe the ſtrangers within</hi> Iſarel's <hi>gates WERE to keep the Sabbath, that the Gentiles without their gates ARE to keep the Sabbath, which is that the Doctor was to prove for this Argument is ſo far from proving the Gentiles ARE to keep it, that it doth not prove the Gentiles in the Queſtion WERE to keep it: for the Queſtion is of all Gentiles except Proſelytes; and the Argument from the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of</hi> Exodus, <hi>proves no Gentiles but Proſelytes; for ſo Mr.</hi> Ainſworth <hi>in his Annotations upon this place, ſaith, That for</hi> Stranger, <hi>the Greek Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion reads</hi> Proſelyte; <hi>and he further adds, That it was the Opinion of the Rabbins, upon this place, That ſtrangers, not circumciſed, might work for themſelves openly upon the Sabbath day, as the Jews did on a working day.</hi>

               <p>It followeth not that it was to any ſtranger without the gate, becauſe the ſtranger within the gate was commanded: and unleſs you can prove that it was to all ſtrangers without the gate, unproſelyted, it doth not reach the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in queſtion, and therefore I ſtill demand your proof of the Minor Propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is obſerveable, that though</hi> Iſrael <hi>was to reſtrain the ſtrangers from labour, yet the ſtrangers were no other then ſuch as were circumciſed within their gates, and under their Law; which is nothing to our purpoſe, who live in</hi> England, <hi>under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi>

               <p>Then I further argue: If every ſin be a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, then they that are bound to abſtain from ſin, are bound to keep all the Ten Commandments; but every ſin is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law: <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                  <hi>The Minor may juſtly be denied, becauſe that it is not a ſin now to work upon the ſeventh day (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called</hi> Saturday) <hi>which was one of the Ten Commandments among the Jews; and therefore though all Chriſtians are to abſtain from all ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law they live under, yet they are not bound to abſtain from ſinning againſt a Law they are not under.</hi>

               <p>I anſwer, By diſtinguiſhing of the term HE, in the Major propoſition: for if you do not mean every he, then I deny the Syllogiſm.</p>
               <p>And if you do mean every he, or every one, then I deny the Minor, for theſe Reaſons:</p>

               <p>Secondly, if the Gentiles were writ to in this Epiſtle, yet I do deny that they are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to keep all the Ten Commandments; for there is no ſuch thing in the Text.</p>

               <p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I further argue:</p>
               <p>If there be never a Commandment but is a point of the whole: If every one of the Ten be a part of the whole: If every part of the Ten be contained in the whole: If he that breaks one Commandment is guilty of the whole; Then he is commanded to keep the whole.</p>
               <p>But he that breaks one Commandments, is guilty of the whole.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is obſervable, that the Doctor made three eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays to bring forth a Syllogiſm to prove the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but could not bring them into perfect Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms: at laſt he makes a Syllogiſm that concludes not the thing in controverſie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>As it hath been anſwered, that S.</hi> James <hi>doth not write to Gentiles, and that he doth not enjoyn the ten Commandments, by this word,</hi> The whole Law, <hi>and ſo conſequently not the Seventh-day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: ſo it may further be anſwered, that if thoſe words,</hi> The whole Law, <hi>ſhould reſpect the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>then if believing Gentiles are bound to the whole Law, they are bound to Circumciſion alſo, and every other Ceremony of the Law: therefore there Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> Gal. 5.3. <hi>that</hi> if they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, they were bound to keep the <hi>WHOLE</hi> Law. <hi>By which it appears, that the believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that were not circumciſed, were not bound to keep the</hi> WHOLE Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that when St.</hi> James <hi>enjoyns the keeping of the whole Law, he tells us what Law he means, in Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

James bids them not to be</hi> forgetful
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40990:16"/>hearers <hi>of,</hi> Jam. 1.25. <hi>but admoniſheth them to</hi> look into the perfect law of liberty, <hi>and to</hi> continue therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that the Doctor had no reaſon to ſay that the Scripture was denyed by his Respondent, becauſe he denyed the Law that required the Seventh-day-Sabbath to be contained in</hi> the whole Law <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by S.</hi> James. <hi>It ſeemeth then very ſtrange, that in a free and publike Diſputation, the Doctor ſhould charge his Reſpondent for denying the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, becauſe he denyed his ſenſe thereof: which was all that the Doctor ſaid unto this laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               </speaker>
               <p>Here Sir you have given away your cauſe at once: for my buſineſs hath been to ſhew you, that the ſeventh-day-Sabbath is not required of believing Gentiles by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was not given to the Gentiles; which is that I have been proving, and you have been denying: and now in the concluſion you ſay it matters not whether it were the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> or no. So then I have proved the thing denyed all this while, by your own
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40990:20"/>words, becauſe you had your liberty to except againſt the enumeration of Laws, in the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm, and you excepted againſt the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> ſaying, The Law of <hi>Nature, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> were all one: ſo that if the ſeventh-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath be not required by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, it is not (by your own confeſſion) required by the Law of Nature, or the Law of Chriſt: and that it is not required by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, I have proved, and ſhall prove further, by this Argument.</p>
               <p>If believing Gentiles are commanded to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath by vertue of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, then they are commanded by that Law, <hi>Exod,</hi> 20.</p>

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the believing Gentiles are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by vertue of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath.</p>

               <p>The Gentiles were bound to keep the Law that was given by God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that of the ſeventh-day Sabbath; and yet not by <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. ONELY, for they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in <hi>Exod,</hi> 16. alſo.</p>

               <p>My Argument doth not ſay they were bound by the 20th of <hi>Exod.</hi> ONELY, but that if they are bound by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <p>Well then, I will anſwer you, and I do ſay, that the great law-giver himſelf ſhall puniſh the breach of the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</p>

               <p>I demanded who the lawgiver hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Tillam.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Well then, I ſhall anſwer further, That ſometime the law-maker doth puniſh immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and ſometimes by his deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and ſometimes by men; and they are properly men, who are Magiſtrates in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, in the Church, when he ſhall fulfil that propheſie, of reſtoring <hi>Counſellors, as at firſt; and Judges, as at the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is obſervable, that though</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>ſaith,</hi> The puniſhment is in force, <hi>yet he hath not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned who IS to inflict it, but in ſtead thereof, tells us, firſt, that</hi> God doth ſometimes puniſh imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately: <hi>to this it may be replyed, that when he puniſheth immediately, it is when thoſe whom he hath appointed to puniſh do not do their duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40990:26"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, He tells us, that ſometime God doth puniſh the tranſgreſſors of his Law,</hi> by his deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels: <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which it may be anſwered, that this is moſt commonly when the Magiſtrates and Miniſters of Juſtice do neglect to puniſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors according as they ought: yet this hinders not, but all this while ſome are appointed to puniſh the ſeventh day Sabbath breakers, if it ought to be kept by the Law of</hi> Moſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>ſaith. God appointeth</hi> men <hi>to puniſh the breach of the ſeventh-day Sabbath; and theſe</hi> men <hi>(he ſaith)</hi> are Magiſtrates in the Church, <hi>&amp;c. but withal he adds, that ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhall be, when the Propheſie of</hi> reſtoring Counſellors as at firſt, and Judges as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>ſhall be fulfilled: But doth not this very ſaying leave</hi> Mr. Ives <hi>his Queſtion unanſwered? For the Queſtion is.</hi> Who God HATH appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>&amp;c. and the Anſwer is,</hi> That there SHALL be Magiſtrates in the Church when the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Propheſie ſhall be fulfilled: <hi>but who then ſhall do it now, is the Queſtion; becauſe the Text cited by</hi> Mr. Tillam, <hi>that exhorts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>doth alſo call upon the ſame people, at the ſame time, to remember the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and JUDGMENTS; ſo that, if beleeving Gentiles ARE bound to obſerve the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>they ARE bound to obſerve the JUDG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>may as well put off the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40990:26"/>of the Statutes, as the obſervations of thoſe Judgments God would have inflicted on the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of his Statutes: and it will not ſerve his turn to wait till God reſtoreth ſuch men: for the Law that commandeth the ſeventh day Sabbath of all the Congregation of Iſrael, doth command all the Congregation to ſtone the Sabbath-breakers to death, being lawfully convicted (before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate) of the fact. So that if</hi> Moſes <hi>Law that requireth the obſervation of the ſeventh-day Sabbath be in force to the Congregations of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles, as it was to the Congregations of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Jews, and the ſame puniſhment (as hath been argued) be in force to the one as well as the other, then by the ſame Law, the beleeving Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among the Gentiles are bound (having convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted any among them of Sabbath-breaking) to ſtone ſuch a man to death: now though ſuch Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that do not keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath by vertue of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, are not tyed thus to do; yet all of</hi> Mr. Tillams <hi>opinion, I mean, all ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations that hold themſelves bound by</hi> Moſes <hi>Law to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath, I ſay, all ſuch Congregations ſtand bound to ſtone that member to death, that ſhall be found to break it, having law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully convicted him by two or three witneſſes: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they any other rule by that Law to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuch an evil, or ſuch an evil doer from among them: and this would hold good in all reſpects, if God ſhould at any time bring a Magiſtrate of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40990:27"/>Commonwealth to be a member in</hi> Mr. Tillams <hi>Church: then by his own grant, if they ſhall convict a member for Sabbath-breaking before ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, then ſuch a Magiſtrate by</hi> Moſes <hi>Law ought to judge him guilty of death; and then it roundly followeth, that all</hi> Mr. Tillams <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt stone that man with ſtones till he die, to put away the evil from among them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who then can be true to this ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-keeping, principally as bound to it by</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, but they muſt alſo ſubmit their necks to ſuch a yoke as this, which is not conſiſtent with that Law of love and charity, which ought to be preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians in the times of the Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus having given a faithful account of the Arguments and Anſwers urged by</hi> Dr. Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain <hi>and</hi> Mr. Tillam, <hi>and</hi> Mr. Ives <hi>the first day, I ſhall now proceed to the Arguments and Anſwers inſiſted on by both ſides the next day, which was on Friday</hi> 7 <hi>of</hi> Jan. 1658.</p>

               <p>The Queſtion agreed to be further diſputed this day, is, Whether all beleeving Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath; and I ſhall deſire, that whoever ſhall ſpeak this day to this queſtion, either as Opponent or Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, may apply themſelves to the right rules of Diſputation.</p>

               <p>Sir, I do not tie you to this or that way; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I think you miſ-apply Scriptures, when you bring them to prove that making Syllogiſms is unlawful, when ſuch forms of Arguing are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found in Scripture: however, Sir, give me leave to uſe it, till I am perſwaded of the unlawfulneſs of it; and I ſhall give you your liberty to prove either by Syllogiſms or by plain Texts, That all believing Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</p>

               <p>There is not a Text ſaith, in ſo many words, (as I have told you) that believing Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath; but there is Text that requireth the People of God and the Servants of God to obſerve it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by conſequence, believing Gentiles are to obſerve it, if they are Gods People and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>

               <p>Sir, what proof you have, you may ſpare it, till we are agreed how to diſpute: however, in the mean time, let me tell you, though you prove the people of God, and the ſervants of God, were required to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath, this will not reach our difference, becauſe the Jewe were called both Gods ſervants and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom we ſay were bound to keep it; but this doth not prove that all believing Gentiles are bound to it.</p>

               <p>Well then, I will proceed to prove, that all beleeving Gentiles are bound to keep the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day Sabbath: Thus:</p>
               <p>If that it be the duty of all men to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath, then it is the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beleeving Gentile; but it is the duty of all men to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is the duty of every beleeving Gentile to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is worthy obſervation, that though</hi> Mr. Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam <hi>had profaned the rules of Syllogiſtical Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cried down all Conſequential ways of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the lawfulneſs of any duty, yet he himſelf is forced at laſt to build up this Sanctuary, that he hath been pulling down, and hallow that way which he had before profaned, by making uſe of it to prove his practiſe, though he had before cried it down as profane.</hi>

               <p>Sir, you argue thus <hi>(viz.)</hi> If it be the duty of all to keep the ſeventh-day, then it is the duty of all beleeving Gentiles: But it is the duty of all men, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Again, I do confute your ſenſe of the word <hi>Adam</hi> out of your own Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. where it is objected, that <hi>ADAM being in honour, did not abide a night,</hi> Pſal. 49.12. your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that it is to be underſtood of ſuch as the context mentions, that truſt in their wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here then you have confuted your ſelf, becauſe ſomwhat may be ſaid of <hi>Adam</hi> that doth not concern every man; therefore the Sabbath might be made for man, and yet not for every man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>did raiſe another Argument,

               <p>
                  <hi>This appears further, if we conſider that ſaying in the</hi> 4th <hi>of</hi> Deut. <hi>and compare it with the</hi> 5th: <hi>in the</hi> 5th <hi>it is ſaid, that when God did give them the Law,</hi> he ſpake with MAN, and he lived: <hi>that this was onely the Nation of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.33. <hi>tells us plainly;</hi> Did ever people hear the voice of God out of the midſt of the fire, as THOU haſt heard, and lived? <hi>&amp; ver.</hi> 35.

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:40990:32"/>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe it reſpects the time in which Sacrifices and burnt-Offerings were to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. where God tells theſe men, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, that if they do the thing that pleaſeth him, that <hi>their Burnt-Offerings and their ſacrifices ſhall be accepted upon his Altar,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſaying in <hi>Eſay</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thoſe ſtrangers that ſhould be Proſelyted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>I ſay the time ſpoken of in <hi>Eſay</hi> 56. is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-times, becauſe in the firſt verſe it ſpeaks of a Salvation to come, and a Righteouſneſs to be revealed: ſecondly, becauſe it ſpeaks of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs that were to be joyned to the Lord; which could not reſpect the times of the Law, becauſe in the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.1. it is ſaid, that <hi>an Eunuch ſhall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>And whereas it is ſaid that this muſt needs reſpect Goſpel-times, becauſe the Eunuch is ſaid to be admitted, which could not be under the Law; I anſwer, firſt, that after ten generations he might enter, though not before; and there was more then ten generations paſſed from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:40990:33"/>to the time of this Prophet <hi>Eſay;</hi> ſo that though the Eunuch could not enter at firſt, yet after ten generations, he might be admitted into the Jews Church.</p>
               <p>Again, I have hinted that theſe could not be Goſpel-times, becauſe they that ſhall be thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſhall offer Sacrifices and Burnt-offerings: to which you have not anſwered a word.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he doth not bid them keep the ſabbath becauſe ſalvation WAS come, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was TO come; which ſhews, that thoſe were duties to be obſerv'd before the coming of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> ſaith in his Argument, that they are the Sons of Strangers, and ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles as could not be joyned to the Jews Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but the Text ſaith the direct contrary, <hi>(viz.) That the Son of the ſtranger HAD joyned himſelf to the Lord,</hi> verſ. 3. and <hi>let not the ſon of the ſtranger which IS joyned to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the ſtrangers that cleave to the Lord,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>them will I bring to my holy mountain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>There is in the Text, <hi>Man, and the Son of man,</hi> to take hold of this Righteouſneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be underſtood of every man.</p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay, here is Burnt-offerings in the Text, as well as keeping the Sabbath; I anſwer: what is meant by <hi>Burnt-offerings,</hi> is doubtful, it being a word of a various ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40990:34"/>but he that takes believers to be Prieſts, may take their Services to be Sacrifices: and this I the rather think, becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>When this ſalvation is come, then they ſhall keep the ſabbath.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſaith, (if you will believe him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> that this houſe, in this 56 of <hi>Eſay,</hi> is the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Temple, out of which he whipt thoſe that bought and ſold; and this he calls a houſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, according as it was written by the Prophet: but Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> ſaith, if you will believe him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Chriſt, that this houſe of prayer is the Church of the new Teſtament.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40990:34"/>

               <p>Fourthly, I would demand of Mr. <hi>Tillam,</hi> wherever Goſpel-ſervices are called BURNT OFFERINGS: ſo that whereas he ſaid, he would bring plain Text to prove his practiſe, he turns all plain Texts into Allegories; and is this to argue without a Conſequence?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Moabs</hi> People muſt have ten Generations in the full profeſſion of religion, before they could be admitted; and ſo muſt theſe Eunuchs: again, the Jews would not admit of Greeks into the Temple, which were Gentiles; which ſhews that this Text ſpeaks not of any other time then the time of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas it is ſaid by Mr.</hi> Tillam, <hi>that the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers mentioned in the Text are the ſons of</hi> Adam, <hi>who ever denyed that? for whoſe Sons ſhould they be elſe? uuleſs he will fall into the Fancy of ſome, that tell us of men before</hi> Adam.</p>

               <p>

               <p>It doth not follow, that all Nations ſhould not, or could not ſo account of Gods houſe in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as to call it a <hi>houſe of Prayer,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40990:35"/>that houſe could not contain them all. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the text ſaith not that all Nations ſhould be contained in it, but that all Nations ſhould ſo call it: and that of all Nations it was ſo called, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.5. that <hi>there were at Jeruſalem, devout men, out of every Nation under Heaven.</hi> And thirdly, I ſhall deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that the text in <hi>Eſay</hi> under debate, might be compared with <hi>Matthew</hi> 21.13, <hi>and</hi> 14. and then you will be able to judge, whether Chriſt or Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> is the beſt expoſitor of the houſe of God ſpoken of in the 56 of <hi>Eſay;</hi> which is all I ſhall ſay to this Argument: and if this text reſpects not the Beleevers in Goſpel-times, as by what hath been ſaid it doth not; then hath not Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> proved his Argument, which was, that the Gentiles that could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted (which he underſtands for Chriſtian Gentiles) were bound to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath: but I ſhall ſay no more.</p>

               <p>I am to prove, that all beleevers are not bound to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath; and in order hereunto I have urged this Argument:</p>
               <p>That if beleeving Gentiles are not bound, then all beleevers are not bound:</p>
               <p>But beleeving Gentiles are not bound.</p>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:40990:36"/>
               <p>The Minor being denied, I proved it by this enumeration <hi>(viz.)</hi> If all beleeving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are bound to keep the ſeventh-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, they are bound, either by the Law of Nature, <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Chriſt: but all beleeving Gentiles are not bound, either by the Law of Nature, <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Chriſt, to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath: <hi>Ergo,</hi> All beleeving Gentiles are not bound to keep the ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>It was anſwered yeſterday, that beleeving Gentiles were bound by the Law of <hi>Moſes to</hi> keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath; ſome Arguments were then urged, to prove that beleeving Gentiles are not bound by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath; the laſt of which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments did relate to the 20 of <hi>Exodus;</hi> which I thus framed, and do again urge it, that it may be anſwered.</p>
               <p>If that Law <hi>Exod.</hi> 20, which requireth the obſervation of the ſeventh-day ſabbath, be in force to the beleeving Gentiles, then the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to the traſgreſſion of that Law, by the Law-makers appointment is in force to the beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo.</p>

               <p>The Dr. ſhould have directed his anſwer to my Argument, by aſſigning a puniſhment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Law-maker to be inflicted upon beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> for not keeping the ſeventh-day ſabbath; but in ſtead thereof, he confeſſth that the Law is of no force without a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: well then, by his own confeſſion, if there be no puniſhment to be inflicted upon the beleeving Gentiles, then the Law that commands (if any ſuch there be) hath loſt its
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40990:37"/>force and vigor: and that the puniſhment is not in force; I prove by this Argument: If the puniſhment due to the breach of the ſeventh-day ſabbath, required <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. be in force by the Law-makers appointment to beleeving <hi>Gentiles,</hi> then the Law-maker hath appointed ſome or other to inflict it; but he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none to inflict it. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall find out a better anſwerer then my ſelf, and that is the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15. in which text, an <hi>evil doer</hi> is the general word; and all evil doing is puniſhable by the Magiſtrates; theſe are Sermons preached by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Argument was, If the puniſhment in the LAW be in force, then God hath appointed ſome or other to inflict it; and if he hath, I deſired the Doctor to aſſign who God had appointed to inflict that puniſhment upon beleeving Gentiles, which was appointed in the Law for ſeventh-day ſabbath breakers; and in ſtead thereof, he cites ſeveral texts, which we well knew before, none of which requireth the Magiſtrate to puniſh the <hi>beleeving Gentiles</hi> with death, for not obſerving the ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: For firſt, here is no mention made of the Sabbath, nor of the puniſhment what it ſhould be.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40990:37"/>
               <p>Secondly, If by the Magiſtrates puniſhing all evil, muſt be meant all the evils againſt the firſt Table, as well as the Second, then the Magiſtrate may and muſt determine all Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truths, and puniſh ſuch as ſhall err from his determination: which the Dr. will not allow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Dr. hath at one blow given away the Cauſe which the good people of this land have contended for in blood for this many yeers.<note n="*" place="margin">Which is, that they might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to worſhip God according to their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that the Magiſtrate may not be a judg in Spirituals, to puniſh with death or impriſonment all that differ from him in matters of faith or worſhip.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, It is a begging the Queſtion, to take it for granted, that Sabbath-breaking (I mean the ſeventh-day Sabbath-breaking) is an evil, before it be proved to be ſo.</p>

               <p>I ſhall own, and have printed, that Magiſtrates are allowed of God to puniſh the duties of the firſt and ſecond Table; only with this caution, that he is not to apply Legal puniſhments to Goſpel ſins, nor Goſpel puniſhments to Legal ſins; and this I have proved out of the evidences of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> ſo that as the Magiſtrate is to puniſh all outward Idolatry, Swearing and Blaſphemy, ſo alſo the Sabbath, but not that which is of mans invention; but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40990:38"/>Sabbath which the Lord ſanctified, and for which he calls himſelf Lord of ſabbaths; and Chriſt was both a keeper and preacher of this Sabbath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.: now then, for a man to keep nine of the Commandments, and ſay, the ſeventh-day ſabbath which makes up the tenth is of no force, is againſt Chriſt.</p>

               <p>I have offered, that if the Magiſtrate be to puniſh all Idolatry by Gods appointment, and alſo the breach of the ſeventh-day ſabbath, then he muſt alſo judg what is Idolatry, and what is Sabbath-breaking; and if ſo, the Dr. may not be long before he be convicted. For Idolatry is not only worſhipping falſe Gods, but the true God in a ſalfe manner.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Idolatry was in the Law pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable with death, and the ſabbath-breaker was to be ſtoned to death. Now if the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> be in force, and the puniſhment thereof in force againſt thoſe that keep not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday-ſabbath, and (as you have ſaid) the Civil Magiſtrate is to inflict it, then (according to your opinion) the Reaſon why we live, is, becauſe of the wickedneſs of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; for if the Civil Magiſtrate did but that which you call his duty, we ſhould all of us by your Opinion be ſtoned to death before to morrow morning, that do not keep the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday-Sabbath.</p>

               <p>I am not a Judge of Magiſtrates, but do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto them: ſecondly, let none be afraid of this text, for he that is in Chriſt is above the Law, and it was not made for him, for he that is in Chriſt cannot ſin: Neither do I ſay, that the Magiſtrates have power to puniſh ſpiritual ſins
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40990:39"/>with legal puniſhments, but ſpiritual ſins with ſpiritual puniſhments: and this they may very well do, if they have but good Miniſters to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If the Magiſtrate muſt puniſh all evil (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your ſence of that text) then he muſt puniſh ſpiritual as well as corporeal Idolatry, when the Offendor ſhall be convicted of it; and he muſt puniſh it according to his Judgement and Conſcience: ſo that if it be the Magiſtrates Duty to take away the lives of their Subjects for not obſerving the ſeventh-day Sabbath, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows roundly, that the reaſon why we live, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the wickedneſs of the civil Magiſtrate, a wickedneſs (if the Doctors opinion be true) for which both Magiſtrates and People ſhould die without mercy, if once a Magiſtrate ſhould be ſet up, that is of the Doctors perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>But the main ſtreſs of my Argument lyeth in this, That God never appointed the Gentile-Magiſtrates, to execute the puniſhment which he in the Law did command ſhould be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that broke the ſeventh-day ſabbath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and to this the Doctor hath given no anſwer, ſave that the Magiſtrate is to puniſh all evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he hath not ſhewn us that ſeventh-day ſabbath-breaking is an evil, nor that the Magiſtrate is to puniſh it according to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, if it were an evil; which are the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40990:39"/>two main things that have been objected, to which he hath given no kinde of Anſwer, though they have been urged to him, once and again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But inſtead of anſwering, tells us, that</hi> none ſhould be afraid of the text, <hi>(I ſuppoſe he means the texts in the Law, that threaten the breach of the ſeventh-day Sabbath with death) his reaſon is, becauſe</hi> he that is in Chriſt, is above the Law, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was not made for him; for he that is in Chriſt cannot ſin, <hi>&amp;c. If this be true, that thoſe that are in Christ are above the Law, and that the Law was not made for them, I wonder why the Doctor ſhould keep ſuch a ſtir to engage believers to obſerve the Law, and the ſeventh-day Sabbath, which he calls a part of the Law. And if they that are in Chriſt (as he ſaith) cannot ſin, then it follows, that either none are in Chriſt but thoſe that keep the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or if they may be in Chriſt that do not keep it, then</hi> it is no Sin not to obſerve it, <hi>ſince (if the Dr. ſaith true) they that are in Chriſt cannot ſin: ſo that one abſurd opinion is the cauſe of many; for is it not abſurd to ſay, that</hi> thoſe that are in Chriſt cannot ſin, <hi>and afterwards charge believers in Chriſt with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> judge, ſince the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 4 <hi>Set them to judge that are leaſt eſteemed in the Church:</hi> now if the weakeſt are to be choſen for Judges, ſuch Magiſtrates will not ſuffer their eyes to be blinded with gifts; and he will inflict puniſhment upon falſe witneſſes eſpecially when ſuch Magiſtrates are aſſiſted with Gods Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſome of the forementioned paſſages anſwer hath been made, in that</hi> Mr. Ives <hi>hath told the Dr. that his urging the text (that ſaith,</hi> the Magiſtrate is to puniſh all evil) <hi>is impertinent, till he hath proved the ſeventh-day ſabbath breaking an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and if that could be done, yet this text doth not prove that the Magiſtrate is bound to puniſh it by ſtoning the offender to death, which Dr.</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain <hi>ſaith,</hi> is a puniſhment yet in force to the beleeving Gentiles. <hi>And whereas Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>deſired the Dr. to aſſign who ſhould judge, he moſt impertinently cites</hi> 1 Cor. 6.4. <hi>and tells us,</hi> that the weakeſt in the Church ſhould be choſen Judges. <hi>Well then, if the weakeſt ſhould be choſen Judges,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I demand, Whether they ſhould be choſen out of that Church whereof Dr.</hi> Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain

                  <hi>is a member, or out of a Church that is not of his minde about the ſeventh-day ſabbath?

               <p>
                  <hi>But if they ſhould be choſen out of a Church that is not of the Doctors mind about the ſeventh-day Sabbath, then it cannot reaſonably be imagined that ſuch Magiſtrates would put that Law in execution that ſaith the ſeventh-day Sabbath-breaker ſhall be ſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sir, You argue in ſtead of anſwering, which is not fair; however, let me tell you, that it doth not follow, that all an Epiſtle doth belong to the Gentiles, becauſe ſome doth; and there is no great difficulty to make this appear: for, may not a Prophet ſpeak againſt extortion, and againſt unmercifulneſs to poor brethren, which is every bodies duty to fly from, and a ſaying that belongs to all; yet may not the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet exhort to burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, a duty that did belong but to ſome, &amp; not to all? So that it followeth not that a man ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim thoſe things that are his duty in ſuch and ſuch a Propheſie, becauſe there is mention made of things that are not his duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May not a man as well ſay, that Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>muſt own all the Ceremonies of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, which I hope he hath more Grace, then ſo to do, becauſe he owns a part of it</hi> (viz.) <hi>the ſeventh-day ſabbath, and the puniſhment thereunto annexed? I ſpeak not this in favour to the diſowning of any part of</hi> James <hi>is Epiſtle, or any other part of ſacred writing, but to ſhew you how irrationally Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>argueth: for is it not the ſame, You own a part of</hi> James <hi>his Epiſtle</hi> (viz.) <hi>that of</hi> anointing with oyl <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to beleeving Gentiles:</hi> Ergo, <hi>You muſt own all the reſt? In like manner Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>owns a part of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law</hi> (viz.) <hi>that of the ſeventh-day Sabbath:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>muſt own all</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:40990:43"/>Moſes <hi>Law, and all the Ceremonies therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>James</hi> in this Epiſtle, as <hi>Paul</hi> in ſome others, might ſpeak ſome things that more properly relate to Jews, and other ſome things that relate more generally both to Jews and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Again, I have proved, that none but thoſe that are circumciſed were bound to keep the WHOLE LAW. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. in that univerſal ſence in which Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> accepts this word the WHOLE Law, ſo as to include the ſeventh-day Sabbath; and this is not my opinion only, but the opinion of the modern Jews, which ſay, that whoſoever will keep their Sabbath, muſt firſt be circumciſed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Tillam.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>There is no difference between Jew and Greek, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11, 12. and if <hi>Mr. Ives</hi> will exclude one part of <hi>James</hi> his Epiſtle from relating to beleeving Gentiles, he muſt exclude it all.</p>
               <p>Again, Both Jews and Gentiles are to walk by one Law, and have but one Law-giver that is able to ſave and deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Again, I ſay, that information of the modern Jews is falſe; and though they have told us, that from the middle upward we are Jews, yet from the middle downward we are Gentiles; but the other ſaying I do not remember.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
               <p>Whereas he ſaith, beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> are bound to the whole Law mentioned in <hi>James</hi> 2. I add, that <hi>James</hi> himſelf being a Jew, and writing to the twelve Tribes among which there were ſome beleevers, and very many unbeleevers, <hi>as appears by the complaint he makes of the pride, and oppreſſion, and unruly talking that was among them; now from that Law, that theſe unrighteous Jews pretended to live by, and to be juſtified by, the Apoſtle goeth about to convince them, by telling them, that whoſoever ſhould pretend to the whole Law, and yet err in one point, he is guilty of all; as much as if he ſhould ſay, If you will be keepers of the Law, you muſt keep it perfectly, or you do nothing: I would fain know, how ſuch an interpretation (ſuppoſing it to be a falſe gloſs upon the text) ſhould incur the cenſure of denying the whole of</hi> James <hi>his Epiſtle to be of any uſe to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although there be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jew and Gentile in point of <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Goſpel-priviledges, in as much as the Jew cannot be juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Chriſt, even as the Gentiles are;</hi> yet the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are not bound to obſerve all edicts that were at that time impoſed upon the Jews. And leſt this ſeem ſtrange, I pray conſider <hi>Acts</hi> 21.23, 24, 25. where it is obſervable, that a holy Convocation of Apoſtles and Elders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40990:44"/>met at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did injoyn <hi>Paul</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſomethings which at no hand they would have the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to obſerve, but gave them a ſolemn charge to the contrary; for in the 23, <hi>and</hi> 24 <hi>verſes,</hi> the Aſſembly of Apoſtles and Elders do enjoyn <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>DOE this that WE ſay to thee: we have four men which have a vow upon them, them take, and purifie thy ſelf with them, and be at charges with them, that they may ſhave their heads, and ALL may know that thoſe things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing, but that thou thy ſelf walkeſt orderly and keepeſt the Law. But as touching the GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TILES which beleeve, we have written and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that THEY obſerve NO SUCH thing,</hi> &amp;c. Here we ſee a holy convocation of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Elders, guided by the Spirit of truth, do require that of <hi>Paul</hi> being a Jew, that they expreſly command the Gentile. beleevers not to obſerve. <hi>Would it not be ridiculous then for a man to ſay, that I muſt either obſerve all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles injunctions to the Jews; or elſe, that I must reject all the injunctions of the Apoſtles, even thoſe that concern the Gentiles? for after this rate Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>reaſons</hi> (viz.) <hi>that I muſt either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all</hi> James <hi>his Epiſtle, or none at all, becauſe (ſaith he) there is no difference between Jew and Greek. Now then, by this place in the</hi> 21 <hi>of the</hi> Acts <hi>you ſee there was ſome difference by order from the Apoſtles in point of obſervation, but no difference in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40990:44"/>point of justification, which is the ſcope of the Apoſtle in that text cited by</hi> Mr. Tillam, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11, 12. There is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the ſame Lord over all, is RICH unto all that call upon him: <hi>ſo that the Argument remains unanſwered: for all that</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>hath ſaid, becauſe the Scripture ſaith plainly</hi> that the uncircumciſed <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not bound to keep the whole Law, <hi>therefore from thoſe words the WHOLE LAVV, the ſeventh-day ſabbath cannot reaſonably be inferred. Neither let any one think to relieve himſelf by the help of this diſtinction</hi> (viz.) <hi>that though beleevers are not to keep the whole Law, as it contains Morals and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, yet they are bound to obſerve the whole Law as it contains morals only: for firſt, the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>makes no ſuch diſtinctions as a whole, and a whole Law; neither doth the Scriptures of the New Teſtament make any ſuch diſtinction; for when it ſpeaks of the VVHOLE Law with reference to the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Moſes, <hi>it always includes both Moral, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, and Judicial</hi> Laws, <hi>which are all but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Iſraelites VVHOLE</hi> Law. <hi>But ſecondly, Suppoſe we ſhould allow the diſtreſſed the help of this diſtinction</hi> (viz.) <hi>that ſometime</hi> Moſes Law <hi>is called the</hi> WHOLE LAW, <hi>with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the moral part of it only; as ſuppoſe it ſo in this 2 of</hi> James <hi>now under debate, doth it therefore follow that the ſeventh-day ſabbath is part of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Law? <hi>is not the imagination of ſuch a conceipt as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40990:45"/>this a ſtranger to the heart of an ingenious diſputant who abhors to beg that Queſtion he cannot prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>

               </speaker>
               <p>Whereas you ſay, ſomewhat was injoyned upon the Jews that was not upon the Gentiles; I queſtion if this was not the Apoſtles weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for they were ſubject to like paſſion.</p>
               <p>For at another time a leſs matter then this (mentioned by you <hi>Act</hi> 21.) was counted hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Secondly, <hi>James</hi> is ſpeaking of the Royal Law, but this example of yours, relates to the Law of Ceremonies. Thirdly, if this Epiſtle of <hi>James</hi> were written to believing Jews, then there is one Law for the believing Jews, and another for the believing Gentiles; and if ſo, believing Jews are bound to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath, and believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are not: and how can this be without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer to the laſt firſt, that then your book is full of Confuſion; for in your book you allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both dayes to be obſerved, to wit, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day and the firſt day.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, the Scripture is full of confuſion,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40990:45"/>if you ſay true; for the Scripture tells us of the Jews obſervation of the ſeventh day, and the Gentiles of the firſt day.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, it followeth not that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews are bound by my confeſſion to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath, ſeeing that your term <hi>whole Law,</hi> mentioned in <hi>James</hi> 2. doth not prove the Sabbath to be there intended, any more then it proves circumciſion or any other Jewiſh ceremony.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when I cite a text to ſhew that the Apoſtles being guided by Gods holy Spirit, did order <hi>Paul</hi> (being a Jew) to obſerve ſome things which they ſtrictly commanded the Gentiles not to obſerve, Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> anſwers, That this was the Apoſtles weakneſs; by which it appears, that rather then Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> will be accounted weak, he will brand the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the whole Council of Apoſtles and Elders, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt, with weakneſs: but it is more likely that Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> ſhould be weak, then <hi>Paul</hi> and all that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, among whom the Holy Ghoſt was preſent, in ſo ſolemn a Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>tells us, that</hi> Peter <hi>played the hypocrite,</hi> Gal. 2.13. <hi>in that he compelled the Gentiles to live as do the Jews; I anſwer, that this is nothing to our purpoſe: Firſt, becauſe the text cited by me,</hi> Act. 21. <hi>onely ſpeaks of Jews that were adviſed to live as Jews, and of Gentiles that were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40990:46"/>forbidden ſo to live, verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>but the text in</hi> Gal. 2. <hi>ſpeakes of Gentiles that</hi> Peter <hi>did compel to live as do the Jews, which is clearly another thing: Now then, if this text cited by Mr.</hi> Tillam, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>in which it is ſaid</hi> Peter <hi>was to blame for compelling the Gentiles to live as do the Jews; I ſay, if this text ſerves any thing to the preſent controverſie, it is to ſhew that Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>playes the hypocrite, in that he being (as he calls himſelf) a Miniſter of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, doth command the Gentiles to live as do the Jews, in keeping the</hi> Saturday <hi>for a Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And laſtly, the ſecond of the</hi> Galatians <hi>blames</hi> Peter <hi>ſharply for compelling the Gentiles to live as do the Jews, but there is none but Mr.</hi> Tillam, <hi>that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ever heard of, that ever preſumed to blame, not only</hi> Paul <hi>in what he did,</hi> Act. 21. <hi>but alſo the whole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Apoſtles, in which the holy GHOST was preſent; a piece of ſuch great preſumption, that ſcarce can be parallel'd in any ſtory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas he ſaith the inſtance</hi> Acts 21. <hi>is of the Ceremonial Law, and not of the Royal Law; I anſwer, that all GOD's Laws are Royal: but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though the inſtance in</hi> Act. 21. <hi>be of a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, yet it is ſufficient to ſhew, that ſince the whole Law doth comprehend both Morals and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonials, that believing Gentiles, who are not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, are not bound to keep the while, ſince they are excuſed from obſerving the Ceremonial part of it, by this text</hi> Act. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>ſaith, that, if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40990:46"/>of</hi> James <hi>were writ to believing Jews, then here would be one Law for the believing Jews, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the ſeventh-day ſabbath was a Law to none but Iſrael, and ſuch as were proſelyted to their Religion, then all beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> are not commanded to obſerve it:</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Minor I thus prove.</p>
               <p>That Law which was given as a ſign between God and Iſrael, was a Law to none but Iſrael:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40990:48"/>But the ſeventh-day ſabbath was given as a ſign between God and Iſrael, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.15, 17. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The ſeventh-day ſabbath was a Law to none but Iſrael.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>To the ſabbaths being a ſign, I anſwer, that it is either of things paſt, or of things preſent, or of things to come; if of things paſt, then it is a ſign of the Creation of the world, or elſe it is a ſign of his ſanctifying preſence, which I have found in this obſervation: but that the ſeventh-ſabbath is a ſign of good things to come, I utterly deny.</p>
               <p>Again, If the ſabbath was a ſign, ſo were all the Commandments; and therefore its being a ſign doth not make it void, any more then the reſt of the Commandments, which are alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſigns.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
               <p>Whereas Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> ſaith the Sabbath was a ſign of the Creation, I ſay it was not; for though Heaven and Earth be expreſt in the command of the ſabbath, yet the ſabbath is no where ſaid to be given them for a ſign that <hi>God</hi> made Heaven and Earth; for though <hi>God</hi>'s reſting the ſeventh-day be a reaſon why Iſrael ſhould reſt, yet this reſt is no where called a ſign of the Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is more reaſon to beleeve from the text, that it was one of the ſigns of the Covenant that God
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40990:48"/>in a ſpecial manner had made with that people: See</hi> Exod. 31, 16, 17. Eze. 20.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But further, is it not more rational to beleeve that the ſix days ſhould be a ſign of Gods creating Heaven and Earth, then the ſeventh day on which he did not work? which at the moſt can but ſignifie to us, that then, or on that time, God reſted from all his work. But whoever conſiders of the ſignes that God gave to Iſrael, ſhall find, that they were given them to diſtinguiſh that people from all people in the world; and therefore Mr.</hi> Ainſworth <hi>obſerves upon</hi> Exod. 13.9. The Jews <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> uſed on other dayes to wear their Phylacteries on their arms, or foreheads, for a Sign or a Token to them, as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but they laid them by upon the ſabbath, becauſe (ſay they) the ſabbath it ſelf is a ſigne: <hi>And therefore</hi> Joſephus <hi>calls it,</hi> A Law peculiar to that People, <hi>De bello</hi> lib. 2. cap. 16. <hi>And to this agrees the ſaying of</hi> Nehemiah, <hi>Chap</hi> 9.13. Thou cameſt down upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſpakeſt with them, <hi>[the houſe of Iſrael]</hi> and madeſt known to them thy Holy Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> ſaith, that the whole Law of the Ten Commandments was a Signe, and therefore we may as well lay aſide all, upon the account of their being a Sign, as any one: to this I anſwer:</p>
               <p>That it is not ſaid of the Ten Commandments onely, but of all the Law, as well Ceremonies
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40990:49"/>as Morals, that it ſhould be as a ſigne upon their hand, it doth not therefore follow that theſe were all to continue.</p>
               <p>But farther: It is no where ſaid of all the Law, that it is a ſigne between God and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> but rather a ſigne to diſtinguiſh them from all other people.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, if the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were as a ſigne between God and <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> ſuppoſeth) then I anſwer, that as it was in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was a Law binding to none but Iſrael, and ſuch as were proſelyted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; neither was it given as a ſign to any other Nation.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Tillam.</speaker>
               <p>The ſeventh-day was a ſign of the Creation of the World; for God reſted the <hi>ſeventh-day,</hi> ſaith the Text.</p>
               <p>Again, If that the Commandments are ſigns, they muſt either be between God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or elſe between them and the Devil.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
               <p>That about a ſign hath been anſwered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and I wonder you ſhould delight your ſelf with needleſs repetitions: but however, take a word or two in further anſwer, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That Gods reſting the ſeventh-day is urged by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> as the Reaſon of the Law that injoyns <hi>Iſrael</hi> to keep the ſeventh-day, and not as a Reaſon of the ſign: ſo that though Gods reſting is urged
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40990:49"/>as the Reaſon of the duty, it doth not therefore follow, that it is the Reaſon of the ſign: but as I have ſaid before, I ſhall ſay again, that if all the Commandments were ſigns between God and Iſrael, as they were delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mount, it doth not prove that they were ſignes between God and any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as to your Objection, That</hi> if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madments were ſigns, they muſt either be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Iſrael, or elſe between them and the Devil: <hi>But how doth this appear? might not it be a ſign between Iſrael and all the Nations of the Earth, to ſignifie their ſpecial favour with God above other people; and doth not the text ſay,</hi> the Law ſhould be as frontlets between their eyes, <hi>&amp;c. plainly ſhewing, that God would diſtinguiſh this People by their Laws and Priviledges from all other people; and that by their Sabbaths and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and other Judaical obſervations they ſhould be known to all people that did converſe with them, to be highly in favour with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And laſtly, Their Laws, ſome of them, were called ſigns, becauſe they did ſignifie ſomthing to come, and ſo did their Sabbath; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls it</hi> a ſhadow, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. <hi>But I never heard that their Laws were ſigns between them and the Devil.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Tillam.</speaker>
               <p>If the Creation of the world be a reaſon why
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40990:50"/>Iſrael was to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath, you muſt then (if you be Gods Iſrael) keep the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day upon that reaſon, becauſe they did enjoy the comforts of the Creation, which God brought forth in ſix days: ſince then that Reaſon is the ſame to us, that Law ought to be the ſame.</p>

               <p>The Minor I prove thus:</p>

                  </gap> inſtance; and for what you ſay of a Papiſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> anſwer, that it is one thing to live under a Law that convinceth of ſin, and another thing to acknowledge ſuch conviction: as for example. It is ſaid of the Holy Ghoſt, that <hi>he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40990:51"/>the world of ſin,</hi> and yet we all know the world is not convinced of ſin, ſo as publickly to repent and return.</p>
               <p>Shall I then be ſo barbarous as to ſay, that there is not a Law convincing, becauſe men are not actually convinced of their Idolatry? for doubtleſs, the moſt ignorant Papiſts have a Law, and the Spirit of God convincing them of ſin, though actually they are not convinced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>However, it is manifest that the light of Nature hath at ſome time or other ſo prevailed upon ſome of her children, as that to a great degree they have been convinced of all Moral duties; but to this of the ſeventh-day, Nature never did Proſelyte any of her children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Tillam <hi>making no further reply, and refuſing to aſſign an inſtance either in Scripture, or any other credible ſtory, where Nature did ever convince the Gentiles of ſin for not keeping the ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, Mr. Ives therefore by the requeſt of the Company was deſired to urge another Argument.</hi>

               <p>That Law which is inforced by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt unto <hi>beleeving Gentiles,</hi> ſome or other, at ſome time or other, have either been commended for the keeping, or blamed for the breaking of it.</p>

                  <hi>Here one that ſtood at M.</hi> Ives <hi>his elbow, whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and bid him tell Mr.</hi> Tillam, <hi>That Chriſt commended the woman in the Goſpel, for anointing Him with Oyl; which Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>had no ſooner ſaid, but Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>made this anſwer, that the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required in</hi> James <hi>his Epiſtle, was to be done by the Elders of the Church, and therefore the inſtance did not reach the Caſe: hereupon Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſed that it was not to the Caſe; onely he told Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>and the Audience, that he had uttered it before he was aware, it being ſuddenly ſuggeſted to him by one that ſtood by; however, it is obſervable that the inſtance of anointing with oyl is not a ſufficient inſtance to abate the ſtrength of the Syllogiſm: for the intent of the Syllogiſm is to ſhew, that the ſeventh-day Sabbath is no moral Precept, as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40990:52"/>appears by the laſt Argument that was brought to prove that the ſeventh-day Sabbath was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the light of Nature, and the inſtance is in an inſtitution that is not Moral: So that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Argument was, that there was no MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL Duty required by Chriſt, but ſome were found blameable for not obſerving, or commended for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of it; otherwiſe doubtleſs, both under Law and Goſpel, it's like one may finde ſome particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, that we read of, which we ſhall hear of no complaint for not obſerving, becauſe they were not Duties univerſally to be obſerved by all men, at all times, as Moral Precepts are; as for example: The buſineſs of anointing with oyl is the Duty of none but the Elders: but the ſeventh-day-ſabbath-keeping is (if Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>ſay true) Moral, and to be kept by all: and further, the Duty of anointing with oyl, as it was to be done by ſome perſons, ſo alſo but at ſome times,</hi> (viz.) <hi>when any one of the Church was ſick: but the Sabbath was to be kept every ſeventh day, and that not onely by the Church, but all the world, if Mr.</hi> Tillam <hi>ſay true; ſo that the inſtance is far and wide from the caſe in hand: for the intent of the Argument is, That if Chriſt had inforced the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day upon believers, as a Moral Law, to be conſtantly obſerved, ſome would either have been blamed for breaking, or commended for keeping of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: and this is true of all Moral Laws, being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to be obſerved by all; and there is not any one Moral Law, but ſome in the new Teſtament are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40990:53"/>blame for not obſerving it, or elſe praiſed for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it; but not one word is mentioned of this kinde touching the 7th-day ſabbath, ſince the death of Chriſt; which makes me conclude, it died with Him.</hi>

               <p>I come now to another Argument, which take as followeth:</p>
               <p>If believing Gentiles, by an Apoſtolical tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, may eſteem one day above another, or every day as they are perſwaded in their own minds; then they are not required by Chriſt to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath.</p>
               <p>But believing Gentiles, by an Apoſtolical to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, may eſteem one day above another, or every day as they are perſwaded in their own minds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> believing Gentiles are not required by Chriſt to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I do affirm, that the 7th day is not included nor intended in that text <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and for this ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.4. where the word <hi>every day,</hi> is there intended of every common day, not the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>But if in the text <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. it be underſtood of every day, without exception, then you may not contend for the firſt day of the week.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> excepts againſt the univerſality of the word <hi>every day:</hi> which ſeems to me very ſtrange: for when he cited that text <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.27.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40990:53"/>where it is ſaid, The ſabbath was made for man, he would there have the word <hi>Man</hi> underſtood of <hi>every</hi> man, though the word <hi>every</hi> man was not in the text.</p>
               <p>But now I cite a text that hath this word <hi>every</hi> day in it, and he tells us, that this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal term muſt be reſtrained, and not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>every</hi> day, though <hi>every</hi> day be the words of the text; the Reaſon he gives why <hi>every</hi> day muſt be reſtrained, is, becauſe it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.4. where God ſaith, that the people ſhall gather a certain portion of the <hi>Manna every day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that it doth not follow, that becauſe a general word is reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. that therefore it ſhould be reſtrained in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, <hi>God</hi> himſelf reſtrains every day in the 16 of <hi>Exodus</hi> to the ſix days in which they were to gather Manna, and expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the reſting upon the ſeventh-day; but in the 14 of the <hi>Rom.</hi> neither <hi>God</hi> nor the Apoſtle puts any reſtriction upon the word <hi>every day;</hi> ſo that, though we muſt reſtrain general words when <hi>God</hi> reſtrains them, there is no reaſon that we ſhould reſtrain them when <hi>God</hi> doth not.</p>
               <p>But then ſaith Mr. <hi>Tillam,</hi> If you do not reſtrain this word <hi>every day,</hi> then you do overthrow the keeping of any day. To which I anſwer,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40990:54"/>that we might very eaſily deliver our ſelves out of the hands of this abſurdity, if that were the buſineſs in Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for instance, we have been ſhewing, that we are not obliged by</hi> Moſes <hi>Law to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath, nor no other Judaical days; and that now Chriſt hath taken away theſe obſervations, and hath made all days alike, in that one day hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> more ſanctity or holineſs then another, by reaſon of any</hi> Moſaical <hi>inſtitution, by which formerly it was ſanctified; and ſo by conſequence have ſhewed, that neither</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, nor Chriſts Law, commands a ſeventh-day ſabbath upon that account; which indeed is the ſcope of the Apoſtle in the</hi> 14 <hi>of the</hi> Romans, <hi>that ſo</hi> the beleevers might not bring one another to bondage in ſuch things wherein Chriſt hath made them free: <hi>How then doth this abſurdity fall upon the Arguments,</hi> (viz.) <hi>tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> becauſe we are left at liberty in point of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical <hi>obligations to days, that therefore we may ſpend this liberty to the ſervice of the fleſh, and ſet apart no time at all to ſerve and worſhip God in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> this indeed would be contrary to the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which hath taught all her ſons to ſet apart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> time, in which to worſhip and ſerve their God. But if it ſhould be ſaid, that if God hath left no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, how much time, or what time; then we ſhould not ſin though we obſerved no time; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that this is an abſolute</hi> non-ſequitur: <hi>for firſt, God hath not appointed what maintenance the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40990:54"/>Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould have under the New Teſtament; doth it therefore follow, that we being delivered by Jeſus Chriſt from the</hi> Moſaical <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of maintaining the Miniſters according to the Levitical Law, and ſince we are at liberty and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>njoyned how much, or how little, or in what kind they ſhould be maintained, that therefore they ſhould have no maintenance at all? the like may be ſaid in reſpect of a place of worſhip, as well as a time; for God had under the</hi> Law <hi>tied the Jews to a place of worſhip, but now he hath delivered us from that bondage, and hath made all places alike, as to any</hi> Moſaical <hi>ſanctity; doth it therefore follow, that Chriſtians may from thenceforward chuſe whether they will meet any where or no; or that one belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may run one way, and another another way, and ſo never come to the place where the Church meeteth? too many ſuch libertines were in the Apoſtles days, and, to our great grief, we may ſay, there are too many in our days that turn this Grace and Goſpel-liberty into wantonneſs and licentiouſneſs. This I thought good to add in this place, to ſtop the carreer of that conceipt,</hi> (viz.) <hi>that becauſe Chriſt hath freed us from thoſe days that</hi> Moſes <hi>his Diſciples were hound to obſerve, and hath left the Chriſtians at liberty herein, in that he hath made every day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that therefore we may chuſe if we will keep any day as all to the ſervice of the Lord; this is not only a ſenſual, but a ſenſeleſs imagination: but more of this touching a day to worſhip God in, and alſo what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40990:55"/>day we ought to obſerve for his publick worſhip, ſhall be ſhewn in the enſuing Appendix to theſe Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then (by what hath been ſaid) we may perceive, that we ought not to alter nor vary the literal ſence of a text, unleſs <hi>Gods</hi> word on right Reaſon do warrant us ſo to do: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gods</hi> word, nor right Reaſon doth warrant us to reſtrain the Apoſtles words, when he ſaith, <hi>Some men eſteem one day above another, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>For by the ſame rule we may reſtrain general words when we have no warrant, we may uſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40990:58"/>Sabbath was one, as appears by comparing the 19 <hi>ch.</hi> and 30 <hi>ver.</hi> where keeping the Sabbath is mentioned among the Statutes of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>I ſay, If the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations were caſt out for not obſerving all Iſrael's ſtatutes, and all their judgments, it appears, that the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the heart did convince them that they had ſinned, in that they had not obſerved all thoſe things; and ſo conſequently the Law written in the heart doth convince them of ſin, for not obſerving the ſeventh-day Sabbath.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, Firſt, that you have all this while argued, and not anſwered.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, The text doth not ſay, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were caſt out for that they did not keep all Iſraels Laws, but for that they were guilty of all thoſe unnatural luſts mentioned in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> former part of the Chapter, which he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Iſrael to refrain, and withal to keep all his ſtatutes, leſt he caſt out them as he had done thoſe Nations.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, How doth it appear, that theſe Nations were to keep ALL Iſraels ſtatutes, and all their judgments, by the Law written in their heart? for they might otherwiſe come under the guilt of the tranſgreſſions of the Law of Iſrael, then by Natures conviction; if that ſhould be granted, that cannot be proved <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Nations were to keep all Iſraels laws.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:40990:58"/>
               <p>Fourthly, If you ſay, that the Nations were convinced of ſin by the light of Nature, becauſe they did not keep ALL the ſtatutes that were given to Iſrael, then it will follow that the light of Nature did convince them of ſin, becauſe they were not obſervers of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Laws that were given to Iſrael, for thoſe are mentioned in the 19 Chapter of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus</hi> among the Statutes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as their Sabbaths and other things.</p>

               <p>I do deny that Conſequence; for it doth not follow that the Nations were bound by the light of Nature to keep all Iſraels Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Laws, becauſe they were by the Law writ in their heart to keep all their ſtatutes and all their judgments.</p>

               <p>But you may remember, that I told you, that all the Laws mentioned in <hi>Lev.</hi> the 20.22, 23,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40990:59"/>did include the Sabbath day, required in 19 <hi>ch.</hi> 30 <hi>ver.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>You ſhall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my Sanctuaries;</hi> ſo that if the Nations (as I have ſaid) were caſt out, becauſe they did not keep all Iſraels Statutes, and all their judgments, then they were caſt out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not keep the 7th-day ſabbath.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer as before, that the Text doth not ſay, that the Nations were caſt out becauſe they did not keep all Iſraels Laws, but becauſe they violated the law of Nature by thoſe unnatural and unlawful luſts mentioned in the former <hi>verſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, If they (<hi>viz.</hi> the Nations) were caſt out, becauſe they did not keep all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels Statutes, then they were caſt out, becauſe they did not obſerve the Ceremonial Laws of Iſrael, as well as any of the reſt. And laſtly, whereas you ſay, that the Sabbath mentioned in the 19 <hi>chapter,</hi> is included in all the Laws mentioned in the 20 <hi>chapter:</hi> I anſwer, So is the reverencing the Sanctuary required in the ſame <hi>ver,</hi> where the ſabbath is required, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of ſacrifices, and counting the fruit of the trees as uncircumciſed the firſt three yeers after they were planted; I ſay, all theſe things are as truly commanded in the 19 <hi>chapter</hi> as the ſeventh-day ſabbath, and are as neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that univerſal term, <hi>all the ſtatutes, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40990:60"/>all the judgments</hi> mentioned in the 20 <hi>chapter:</hi> now then, by the ſame rule that you can ſay, the law writ in the heart did require the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Nations to keep all Iſraels ſtatutes, and ſo conſequently the ſeventh-day ſabbath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the nineteenth <hi>chapter;</hi> I ſay, by the ſame rule the Gentile Nations are commanded by the law written in their heart to keep the law that requireth them to reverence the Sanctuary and offer Sacrifices, and count the fruit of the trees uncircumciſed three yeers after they were planted; which cannot be imagined.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, that though the reverencin the Sanctuary, and offering Sacrifices, and counting the trees uncircumciſed, were commandments given to Iſrael; yet theſe are not called ſtatutes and judgments: ſo that, though the Nations were to obſerve all Iſraels ſtatutes by the law written in the heart, yet they were not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all other of their commandments; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I anſwer you by diſtinguiſhing, and ſay, that the Ceremonial laws were Ordinances and Appointments, but not ſtatutes; and though the Nations were to keep <hi>all</hi> Iſraels ſtatutes by the law writ in their hearts, among which the ſeventh-day ſabbath was one; yet the Nations are not to keep thoſe ceremonies mentioned by you, for they are no where called ſtatutes;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40990:60"/>ſo that ſtatutes is one thing, and Ordinances is another.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>There is no difference, and this diſtinction is light as vanity, for all Gods Ordinances are ſtatutes and appointments, and the ceremonial Ordinances were Gods ſtatutes as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laws.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Coppinger.</speaker>
               <p>Where any Laws are called Ordinances, there they are underſtood for the ceremonial laws, and not for the ten commandments or law writ in the heart; and where any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are called ſtatutes, they are not underſtood of the ceremonial laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>ſtandeth up to juſtifie Mr.</hi> Coppinger's <hi>diſtinctions</hi> (viz.) <hi>that Gods laws were one thing, and his ſtatutes and judgments an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and for this he cites</hi> Mal. 4. <hi>where it is ſaid,</hi> Remember ye the Law of Moſes my ſervant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Iſrael, with the ſtatutes and judgments: <hi>from hence</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>would have proved a difference between ſtatutes, laws and appointments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thereupon</hi> Mr. Goſnold <hi>ſtanding by, told both</hi> Mr. Coppinger <hi>and</hi> Mr. Tillam, <hi>that he wondred they ſhould abuſe the audience with ſuch a needleſs &amp; vain diſtinction, ſince that in their conſcience they knew that the word was</hi> ſtatutum eſt, <hi>and that there was no difference between the words ſtatute and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40990:61"/>ſave that the one was a</hi> Latine <hi>word, and the other an Engliſh word; and further, that they might as well ſay, there was a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween likeneſs and ſimilitude, as between ſtatute and appointment.</hi> Mr. Den <hi>alſo being then preſent did ſharply reprove</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>for juſtifying</hi> Mr. Coppinger, <hi>in making this vain diſtinction, ſince that he pretended to learning and ſcholarſhip: and as ſuch a diſtinction doth argue a man to have little of a ſcholar, or elſe little of conſcience; ſo it doth argue a man to have but a ſlender acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Scripture, and therefore unfit to be a teacher; for if either</hi> Mr. Coppinger <hi>or</hi> Mr. Tillam <hi>had been but competently acquainted with the Scriptures, they would never have uttered before many hundreds of people then aſſembled, that the ceremonial laws were never called ſtatutes: for, beſides what hath been ſaid, whoever reads but</hi> Exod. 29.9, <hi>and</hi> 28. <hi>ſhall find the prieſts office called a ſtatute;</hi> and the Prieſts office ſhall be theirs for a perpetual STATUTE: <hi>and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is called a</hi> STATUTE, <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>and the offering is called,</hi> an everlaſting STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTE to make an atonement, <hi>&amp;c.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40990:61"/>men tell us, that the ceremonies were never called ſtatutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well then, ſince it is plain that the ceremonies of the law are called ſtatutes, it followeth that the Gentiles by the law writ in their hearts were not commanded to keep all Iſraels ſtatutes; for then (as hath been urged) they were bound by the law writ in their hearts to keep the ceremonial laws of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, which is among the firſt-born of ſenſeleſs imaginations: this being the iſſue the Argument was brought to,</hi> Mr. Ives <hi>proceeded to another, which was as followeth.</hi>

               <p>This is arguing and not anſwering: but if I ſhould ſuffer you to tranſgreſs the laws and rules of diſputation, and let you argue when you ſhould anſwer; I know you are never able to prove, that the Gentiles without the help of tradition were able to know the ſeventh-day ſabbath by the law and light of nature: and whereas you ſay, the Gentiles did the things contained in the law by the light of nature, and therefore they kept the ſeventh-day ſabbath; I anſwer, firſt, that it is a difficult thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a particular propoſition, when the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are indefinite.</p>
               <p>For the Gentiles did by nature the things contained in the law, inaſmuch as they did ſome good which the law commanded, and forbore ſome evils which the law forbad, as murder, and adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it doth not therefore follow, that becauſe the Gentiles did the things that were contained in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that therefore they did all things therein contained.</p>
               <p>May not a man as well plead for circumciſion, and ſay, that the light of nature taught people to be circumciſed and to offer ſacrifices, becauſe circumciſion and ſacrificing are things contained in the law; and the Gentiles did by nature the things contained in the law, therefore they were obſervers of circumciſing and ſacrificing by the light of nature? <hi>would not every ſenſible man
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40990:63"/>call this a ſenceleſs Argument? and yet thus</hi> Mr. Coppinger <hi>reaſons: The Gentiles did by nature the things contained in the Law;</hi> Ergo, <hi>they kept the ſeventh-day ſabbath: but I ſhall ſhew in the enſuing Appendix, that the Gentiles neither did, nor could keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

               <p>If the Gentiles did thoſe things by the light of nature that were contained in that law that forbad ſtealing and adultery, then they kept the ſeventh-day ſabbath, which was a part of the ſame law:</p>
               <p>But the Gentiles by the light of nature did the things that were contained in that law which forbad ſtealing and adultery.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Gentiles by the light of nature did keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</p>

               <p>I do aſſure you Sir, if it were not but that I had compaſſion on the multitude, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have them go away unſatisfied, I had not ſaid a word to your laſt Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know you were by agreement to anſwer my Arguments; and in ſtead thereof you make Arguments, and turn Opponent, when as you were by Agreement this day to be Reſpondent: however Sir, take this for an Anſwer, that the Gentiles might do by nature thoſe things that were contained in the Law,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40990:63"/>that forbad ſtealing and adultery; and yet the conſequence doth not follow, that therefore they kept the ſeventh-day ſabbath by the light of nature: as for inſtance, a man that keeps the law of the <hi>Turk,</hi> he obſerves a law that forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtealing and murder; doth it therefore follow, that he obſerveth the Law of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe he doth obſerve a law that requireth many of the ſame things which are written in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws?</p>
               <p>In like manner many of thoſe Laws which were written upon the tables of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles hearts, were written upon Iſraels tables of ſtone; doth it therefore follow that all things that were written in tables of ſtone, were writ upon the hearts of Gentiles?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who is there but may perceive the non-conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of this Argument? may not a man as well reaſon thus, The</hi> Turks <hi>obſerve the things that are contained in the Christian Laws, therefore they obſerve all things that are commanded in the laws of Chriſtianity? and further, the</hi> Turks <hi>obſerve that law which the</hi> Engliſh men <hi>obſerve, which requireth that a man ſhould not kill and ſteal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the</hi> Turk <hi>obſerveth the</hi> Engliſh-man's <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which is the firſt day of the week.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, The people in</hi> America <hi>obſerve the things contained in the Jews law, which requireth men not to kill and ſteal; doth it follow, that therefore the people in</hi> America <hi>obſerve the Jews
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40990:64"/>ſeventh-day ſabbath? Are not theſe kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings the ſame with</hi> Mr. Coppingers? <hi>for he ſaith, that the Gentiles did by Nature the things contained in the Jews law, and therefore they kept the Jews ſabbath; but doth not the contrary to this appear? for are there not thouſands of good people in</hi> England, <hi>that do the things that are contained in the Jews laws, in the Apoſtles ſence: that yet never kept the Saturday or Jewiſh Sabbath? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the further proof of this Argument, let me add, that it is impoſſible to keep the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh or ſeventh-day ſabbath without the help of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore the obſervation of that day is not Moral; the reaſon I ſhall give is, becauſe if a man be ſick of a violent diſtemper, that hath bereaved him of his Senſes, yet when this man coms to his right underſtanding again, he will know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a guide, that he ſhould not kill, and that he ſhould not ſteal; but without the guide of tradition he cannot know what day of the week it is, having loſt his account thereof by reaſon of his diſtraction; and therefore Common experience tels us, that this man is forc'd to ask thoſe that are about him what day of the week it is: now then if he did not know what day of the week it was, by reaſon that he had been thus diſtracted, I demand how he could know which was the 7th Day Sabbath; and if he could have known the 7th-day ſabbath by the light of Nature, what need was there for this man being come to his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to inquire what day of the week it was that he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40990:64"/>was then in, more then there was for him to ask, whether he might not kill or ſteal?</hi>

               <p>I ſhall prove the Conſequence, namely, that if the Gentiles by the light of Nature without tradition did do the things contained in the law, that then they did keep the 7th-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath by the light of nature, without tradition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereupon the Moderator did reprove</hi> Mr. Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger <hi>for attempting to argue instead of anſwering</hi> Mr. Ives <hi>his Argument, and therefore did deſire that</hi> Mr. Ives <hi>would urge a freſh Argument, which was as followeth.</hi>

               <p>That law which a man may have an abſolute neceſſity to break, cannot be a Moral law:</p>
               <p>But the law for the ſeventh-day ſabbath a man may have an abſolute neceſſity to break.</p>
               <p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I deny the Major, if by moral law you do mean the law of Nature, or law written in the heart; for it doth not follow that a law is not moral or written in the heart, becauſe one may have a moral or abſolute neceſſity to break it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall prove the Major thus:</p>
               <p>If there be no abſolute neceſſity for me to hate God or my neighbour, then there is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40990:65"/>no abſolute neceſſity for me to break the law in nature:</p>
               <p>But there is no abſolute neceſſity for me to hate God or my neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> There is no abſolute neceſſity to break the law in Nature.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I deny the Major: for though there be no neceſſity for a man to hate God or his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it doth not therefore follow, that there is no abſolute neceſſity to break the law in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
               <p>I prove the Major thus:</p>
               <p>If all the law written in the heart be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in loving God and my neighbour, then it followeth, that if there be no abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to hate either God or my neighbour, that then there is no abſolute neceſſity to break a law in nature:</p>
               <p>But all the law written in the heart is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in loving God and my neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> It followeth, that if there be no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity to hate God and my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, then there is no abſolute neceſſity to break a law in nature.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, that there may be a breaking of the letter of the Law, as that of murder and adultery, and ſtealing; as for inſtance, <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:40990:65"/>was commanded to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaak</hi> contrary to the letter of the law, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>David</hi> was guilty of murder and adultery in the matter of <hi>Uriah</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> for which by the letter of the law he was to die the death; yet there was a neceſſity for him to live, and be ſaved from the puniſhment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the letter of the law.</p>
               <p>Again thirdly, The Iſraelites robbed the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> contrary to the Law, that ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> and yet were juſtified: though the Law ſaith, <hi>The wicked borrow and pay not again;</hi> yet the Iſraelites did borrow of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and payed not again.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, They were not to take a wife that was a whore under the law, and yet <hi>Hoſea</hi> was commanded by God to take <hi>a wife of whoredoms,</hi> Hoſ. 1.2. By all which it appears, that there may be an abſolute neceſſity to break a Moral law in the letter of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, you have not anſwered to my Syllogiſm, which ſaith, <hi>There can be no abſolute neceſſity to hate God or my neighbour:</hi> for none of theſe inſtances that you have inſiſted on do ſhew any ſuch thing, for there is nothing of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God or my neighbour in any of them, being truly conſidered, as I ſhall preſently make appear.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:40990:66"/>
               <p>Secondly, You tell us, there may be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to tranſgreſs the letter of the Law, and for that you urge ſeveral Texts; when as my Argument was not grounded upon the letter of the law, but rather upon the Spirit of it <hi>(viz.)</hi> the law written in the heart; ſo that the inſtances have not anſwered the Argument however, I ſhall anſwer the inſtances: and firſt, you ſay, that there may be an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to commit murder, adultery, and ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. To which I anſwer, that this is ſuch a piece of Divinity that the world did never hear of before; and the firſt inſtance you aſſign is, <hi>Abrahams</hi> being commanded of God to offer up his ſon <hi>Iſaak,</hi> &amp;c. To which I anſwer, that if <hi>Abraham</hi> had killed <hi>Iſaak,</hi> it had not been murder: firſt, becauſe he did not hate his ſon in his heart, while he was going to offer him according to the commandment; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this inſtance doth not touch the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſaith, there is no neceſſity to hate God or my neighbour. But ſecondly, God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> by an immediate Law from Heaven, otherwiſe <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have pretended to any neceſſity that would have juſtified him in this act, neither could he have been judge of this neceſſity, unleſs God had required it: ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat here was no neceſſity for <hi>Abraham</hi> to murder, becauſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: therefore the inſtance is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:40990:66"/>
               <p>Again, as touching the caſe of <hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> there was no moral neceſſity laid upon any to break a moral law, becauſe <hi>David</hi> was not put to death; for, and if there had been ſuch a neceſſity, how doth this reach the Argument, that ſaith, there is no neceſſity to hate God or my neighbour? for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did neither hate God nor their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, in that they did not take away the life of their King, for what he did againſt <hi>Uriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite.</hi> And for your inſtance in the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtealing from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> which you ſay God allowed of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, That firſt there was no abſolute neceſſity for them to ſpoyl the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and ſo conſequently no neceſſity to break a law in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by hating either God or their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſecondly. God gave Iſrael favour in the ſight of the Egyptians, and thereupon the Egyptians let them have jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold voluntarily, and the Iſraelites did not take them by force, therefore there was no breach of a law in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But laſtly, had they taken theſe things by force, it had not been a breach of a law in nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that nature hath taught her children to ſeek for repairs of thoſe that have impaired them, &amp; to take it</hi> per <hi>force, where it cannot be had by fair means: thus God (as well as Nature) by a more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſtruction tells the people of Iſrael, that they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40990:67"/>ſhould ſpoil thoſe that ſpoiled them, which was but a just retribution upon the Egyptians: agreeing with the law and light of Nature:</hi> Otherwiſe it is a ſin to ſteal upon the pretence of the greateſt neceſſity; hereupon <hi>Agur</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8, 9. <hi>Give me not poverty, leſt I be poor and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for your laſt inſtance of the <hi>Prophet Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, his taking a wife of whoredoms,</hi> which you ſay is contrary to a law; I anſwer, firſt, that it is not contrary to the law that is in the heart, becauſe that law cannot always diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a whore and a chaſt woman, though it was contrary to the law of Iſrael. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though a man could diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other, yet there is no moral neceſſity for a man to take the whore, and leave the chaſte woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But thirdly, whereas you ſay, God commanded the prophet to take a wife of whoredoms: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that this is not ſpoken of carnal adultery, for the text doth not ſay he was commanded to take a wife that was a whore, but a wife of whoredoms</hi> (viz.) <hi>a wife from a people that were guilty of great whoredoms in departing from the Lord, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> appears verſe the ſecond.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Coppinger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I make no neceſſity of a mans own making, but I ſay, God can diſpenſe with the breach of moral laws, by giving a countermand, and then
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40990:67"/>the breach of the ſabbath is no breach; though the Prieſts in the law profaned it, yet they were blameleſs; in like manner, if God make a law that a man ſhall not ſhed innocent blood, yet Cods precept to <hi>Abraham</hi> makes it no breach of a moral law; and ſo likewiſe in the other caſes of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſtealing, and the Prophets taking a wife of whoredoms; I ſay, theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termands make it no breach of a Law: and ſo likewiſe upon the ſabbath-day, a man might lead an oxe or an aſs to watering, and not break it, though it be a moral law; but if the men in this generation may do that which the Jews and Diſciples might not lawfully do on the ſabbath-day, then you have taken off my exceptions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Whereas you ſpeak of a neceſſity to break a moral law, when God countermand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that then it is not murder in <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſlay <hi>Iſaak,</hi> or theft in Iſrael to take from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe they had an immediate law from heaven commanding thoſe very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things; but doth it follow, that this law given to <hi>Abraham</hi> was binding to all, or that Gods allowing of Iſrael to ſpoil the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> ſhould give me an allowance to ſpoil my neighbour? and would it not be a ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature for me to ſacrifice my child ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no command, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> would
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40990:68"/>have ſacrificed his child by a command? and in like manner there can be no moral neceſſity to break a moral law, by your own confeſſion, without an immediate and particular command in the caſe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had in the caſe of <hi>Iſaak</hi> and Iſrael in the caſe of ſpoyling the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Now then, if the ſeventh-day ſabbath be moral as you ſay it is, then you can have no moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, by your own confeſſion, to break it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you have an immediate countermand from Heaven ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Now then, ſince you ſay, the law for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-day ſabbath is a moral law, how do you make it appear, that God gave you an allowance to open your ſhop the next day after you chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged me to diſpute for the ſeventh-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which was the ſabbath-day you now plead for? and whereas you did pretend a neceſſity ſo to do, I demand, Whether God ever gave you a command in obedience to which you did open your ſhop upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day ſabbath? ſince you your ſelf ſay, that there muſt be a countermand to juſtifie the doing any thing that contradicts the letter of a moral law; now you have broke the letter of the law, which you ſay is moral, and where is your countermand from God ſo to do? And for the inſtances that you bring of mens lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an oxe to water upon the ſabbath-day; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was not a moral neceſſity, for they might have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40990:68"/>let the oxe ſtayed without water: if the law for the ſeventh-day ſabbath had been a moral law, they ought not to have broken it to ſave the life of their oxe, no more then a man may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip an Idol to ſave his own life, and the life of his cattle; ſo that this very inſtance confutes your opinion, that the ſeventh-day ſabbath is not a moral law.</p>

               <p>As touching my opening ſhop upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day, which I ſay is the ſabbath, Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> did allow me ſo to doe, becauſe I was under ſome promiſes to do ſome buſineſs that day in relation to my trade. But ſuppoſe I did that which was unlawful, this doth not prove what Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> ſaith, that he may break the ſabbath; however, this is reflection and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Again, I ſay, the moral law makes no difference between murder and killing; for it is written <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a breaker of that law, by going about to kill <hi>Iſaak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo if a childe were born, and the ſeventh-day of the week happened to be the eighth day after the birth, then it was no breach of the law to circumciſe the child; but Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> hath broken his promiſe, in that he promiſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the Argument he inſiſted on the laſt day, but doth not.</p>

               <p>I anſwer to the laſt firſt, that I have not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any promiſe that I made, for I laid down one general Argument, which was the ſame I went upon the laſt day, which I am yet proſecuting.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, You did alſo agree that I ſhould urge new Arguments if I pleaſed, as well as thoſe which had been formerly urged: and whereas you charge me with reflections and uncharitableneſs; I anſwer, that what I ſpake did relate to the diſpenſation that Mr. <hi>Tillam</hi> gave you to open ſhop upon your ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, after you had ingaged to diſpute for it.</p>
               <p>And I ſay, if the ſeventh-day ſabbath be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, then he could not diſpenſe with your ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhop upon it; for by this rule a man may plead a neceſſity to break moral laws, although he hath no countermand from God ſo to do: &amp; whereas you ſay, I did allow you to open ſhop; I anſwer, So I might, becauſe I am ſo far from judging the obſervation of the ſaturday-ſabbath a moral duty, that I judge it no duty at all, therefore I might diſpenſe with your working upon it; but how could Mr. <hi>Tillam,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves with you, that the command for the ſeventh-day is moral, give you a diſpenſation ſo to do? and further, how could your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience diſpenſe with ſuch an action, as to open your ſhop the next Saturday ſabbath that came,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40990:69"/>after you had ingaged in publick to diſpute the morality of that day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas</hi> Mr. Coppinger <hi>ſaith, the Moral law makes no difference between murder and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he might as well have ſaid, that the moral law makes no difference between fornication and lying with a woman, then which nothing is more abſurd. For the Moral law doth not call all killing, murder; though murder be killing; he might as well have ſaid, becauſe ſtealing is taking, that therefore there is no difference between ſtealing and taking.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, The Couſequence of the Major is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40990:71"/>good, becauſe according to your opinion and confeſſion, the beleeving Gentiles are bound to obey the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the law in nature; if ſo, then the unbeleeving Gentiles are bound by the Law in Nature alſo, becauſe the Law of Nature is the ſame to the unbeleever in reſpect of the power of it, as it is to the beleever.</p>
               <p>And the Minor I prove <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Gentiles have not <hi>Moſes law</hi> to command them; and this I do by the words of the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. the Gentiles which HAVE NOT THE LAW, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I argue.</p>
               <p>That it was either the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the <hi>law</hi> of Nature which the Text ſaith the Gentiles had not.</p>
               <p>But it was not the <hi>law</hi> of Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> It was the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is manifeſt that they were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law of Nature: for the Text ſaith, <hi>That was written in their hearts,</hi> ver. 15. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Argument is proved, that the law they were without was the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law they could not be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I do diſtinguiſh of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it was written and unwritten. Now though the Gentiles had not <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in writing, yet they had it unwritten: ſo that it doth not follow,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40990:71"/>becauſe the text ſaith, the Gentiles were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, that therefore they had it not in any ſence; for they had the ſame Law the Jews had, only they had it not in writing: as for inſtance, the Records of the Law are kept at <hi>London,</hi> is not <hi>York</hi> therefore under the ſame Law? But ſuppoſe we ſhould read the Text as Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> notions it, that the Gentiles had not the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> would it not be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous? and further, this Law in the ſecond of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is the Law that all were to be be judged by at the day of judgment, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. which is one and the ſame Law ſpoken of throughout the whole <hi>Chapter.</hi> Therefore the Law written in the heart, and the Law upon Tables of ſtone, are all one and the ſame Law; ſo that they (<hi>viz.</hi> the Gentiles) had the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> unwritten, though not written; and therefore your Argument is not proved from the Text.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Ives.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Coppingers</hi> Anſwer had been good, if he had ſhewn us by the Scripture that there was a Moſaical Law unwritten; which I think is a conceit that the whole world is a ſtranger to; and if Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> cannot do this, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is no anſwer.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, that the Law of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. is not the Moſaical Law as he imagineth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe then the Holy Ghoſt makes a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40990:72"/>needleſs diſtinction, of having a Law, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Law; and of being under the Law, and without the Law, if there were no more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then there is between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For thoſe that live at</hi> York <hi>are under the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law of</hi> England, <hi>though thoſe Laws are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at</hi> London, <hi>becauſe Proclamations are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſent down and poſted in their market places; ſo that the diſtinction is not made good by the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude: for</hi> York <hi>is as truly under the written law, as London, and in no ſence can be ſaid to be without law; and ſo were all the cities of Judea, though at a diſtance from Jeruſalem, under the written law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>becauſe they were to have copies of the law in every city by Gods appointment, to be read among them. But the Gentiles are therefore ſaid to live without the law, becauſe they had not the law of</hi> Moſes; <hi>which diſtinction would be vain, if whatſoever was written in</hi> Moſes <hi>law in tables of ſtone, was writ in the hearts of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo; for then in no ſenſe they could be ſaid to be without the law, and not under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay the ſenſe of the Text is not good as I notion it, you might as well ſay the ſenſe of the Text was not good as the Apoſtle notions it; for I ſaid no more in my Argument, then the Apoſtle ſaid in the text, <hi>(viz.) That the Gentiles were without law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, whereas you ſay, this Law that the Gentiles lived under is <hi>Moſes</hi> law, becauſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40990:72"/>all were to be judged by it; I anſwer, that the contrary is moſt true, as appears by conſulting the text. For the Text doth diſtinguiſh the law of Nature from the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe that every body ſhall not be judged by the Jews law, but them that ſinned without the law ſhall be judged WITHOUT the law: whence I argue, that if the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> be ſo differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that God will not judge every body by it, then the difference is more then in the meer writing and tranſcribing of it: But the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſo different, that God will not judge every body by it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the difference is more then a meer writing and tranſcribing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for example,</hi> Mr. Coppinger <hi>told us but now, that there was no more difference between the Jews living under the law, &amp; the Gentiles living without the law, then there is between the people that live at</hi> York <hi>and</hi> London; <hi>if the difference be no greater as he would make us beleeve, how coms it to paſs that at</hi> York, <hi>the people are judged by the ſame law as we are judged by at</hi> London? <hi>and yet the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> The Gentiles that lived without the law, ſhall be judged without the law; <hi>which plainly manifeſts both a formal and a material diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the law of</hi> Moſes <hi>and the law written in the heart.</hi>

                  </gap>w I will ſhew, that the difference doth lie onely in writing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26, 27. where it is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40990:73"/>ſaid, If the Gentiles in uncircumciſion keep the Righteouſneſs of the Law, that his Unicircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſhould be counted for Circumciſion; And ſhall not uncircumciſion which is by Nature, if it fulfil the Law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumciſion doſt tranſgreſs the Law? Now how could the Gentiles uncircumciſion be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for circumciſion, if he kept the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law, if this Law were not the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the Difference is made in the word <hi>Letter,</hi> ſo that the fault of the Jews is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in that they deſpiſe the Law, becauſe it is ſent by two Meſſengers from God unto them, both in writing, and otherwiſe planting it in the hearts; ſo that the difference is oppoſed in the word <hi>Letter.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſaith, the difference between the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and Nature is oppoſed in the word <hi>Letter:</hi> if ſo, then he hath confuted himſelf, for that they cannot be the ſame, if they are oppoſed one to the other.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct from the Law of Nature, as appears by that text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20, 21. where the Apoſtle ſaith, That to them that were without the Law, he was as without Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now what could the Apoſtle do in a way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance to make the Jews believe that he was not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40990:73"/>without the Law, and to make the Gentiles think he was under the Law, if the Law of the one was no way differing from the other but in writing? Then they could not be diſtinguiſhed by Actions: but that the Jews were diſtinguiſhed from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by their different Laws, is plain, in that</hi> Paul <hi>did blame</hi> Peter <hi>for compelling the Gentiles to live as do the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſhall further prove by reaſon, that the Law of Nature cannot be the ſame with the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe that which is called the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> where-ever it is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is always underſtood of the whole Law, as well the Ceremonial as the Moral, which I hope Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> will not ſay was all of it written in the Tables of the Gentiles hearts: and this appears by the Text mentioned by Mr. <hi>Coppinger,</hi> John 7.23. the Jews did cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe a man, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> might not be broken.</p>

I anſwer, That the Apoſtle could not make a difference between believing Jews under the Law, and believing Gentiles without the Law; becauſe that the Gentiles were under EVERY part and parcel of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40990:74"/>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>As many as are under the Law, are under the curſe:</hi> and the Gentiles were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal</hi> 4.8.

               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, That the Gentiles that had a Law writ in their hearts, were under the curſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the breach of that Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt came to redeem them from the curſe of it: But doth it follow, that becauſe Chriſt came to redeem the Gentiles from the curſe of the Law, that therefore the Gentiles lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ALL, the Law, and every part and parcel of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and were in danger to ſuffer all the penalties and curſes due to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, among the Gentiles there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many Jews, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Romans, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Behold, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> called a Jew,</hi> &amp;c. and yet they lived among the Gentiles who were <hi>Romans:</hi> ſo in like manner among the <hi>Galatians</hi> lived many Jews, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Peters</hi> compelling the Gentiles to live as do the Jews, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. And again, it is ſaid, <hi>Gal</hi> 4. That <hi>the child differeth nothing from a ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. Which muſt needs be meant of the Jews: So that Chriſt redeemed the Jews
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40990:74"/>from the curſe of their Law, and the Gentiles from the curſe of their Law: but this doth not prove, that becauſe Chriſt redeemed both from the curſe, that therefore both Jew and Gentile lived all under one and the ſame Law. And this is further proved by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. when he ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever is circumciſed, is a debter to do the whole Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I argue:</p>
               <p>That if the Law of Nature had bound the Gentiles to keep all the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then they had been indebted to the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> without Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>But the Gentiles were not indebted to the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> without Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Law of Nature did not bind the Gentiles to obſerve the whole Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which it is plain, that the Apoſtle doth diſtinguiſh between the Law of the Jews and the Law of the Gentiles, and the curſe of both according to the breach of thoſe different Laws they lived under.</p>

               <p>Whereas you talk of Circumciſion, I ſay that Chriſt hath ſet us at liberty from Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and therefore we ought not to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.</p>

               <p>But Chriſt hath redeemed none from the Law of Nature; which ſhews plainly that the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not writ in the hearts of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, if Chriſt hath redeemed the Gentiles from the Law of Nature, then though your ſeventh-day Sabbath were writ in the Law of Nature, yet the Gentiles were not bound unto it.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, your anſwer was, That the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were bound to all the Ceremonies of the Moſaical Laws; which I have diſproved, by ſhewing that the Gentiles were bound to the Law of Ceremonies by the Obligation of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and not by the light of Nature.</p>

               <p>I do ſay, That the Gentiles were under all the Ceremonial Laws, as well as under all the Moral Laws, even by the Law writ in the heart, even all the Law, all Sacrifices, every bit and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>He hath redeemed them that were under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. Meaning Gentiles as well as Jews. Now that this was the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that the ſame ſpirit writ the ſame things in the hearts of the Gentiles that the Angel did command upon mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Again, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Law, ſaith, <hi>The man that doth them ſhall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3.12. to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40990:75"/>this agreeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. So that all <hi>Moſes</hi> law was the ſame with the law written in the heart, and was for Jews and Gentiles indifferently, the one for both people as well as the other: for God intended that the Tables of ſtone ſhould be kept in the hand of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and from thence it was to be conveyed to others, <hi>Romans</hi> the 9th and 4th.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I need make no further anſwer then to ſay, That Chriſt was made under the Law to redeem them that were under the Law, that is, thoſe that are under the law of Nature, from the curſe thereof; and them that are under the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> from the curſe due to the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions thereof; and not to redeem the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles from the curſe due to the tranſgreſſion of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which they are expreſly ſaid not to be under.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Gentiles by the light of Nature were not under the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is clear, in that ſome lived in <hi>terra incognita,</hi> and alſo in the Antipodes: and beſides, the text ſaith plainly, that the Gentiles were not under the law, and I muſt ſtick to that, what ever you ſay, unleſs you ſpoke more reaſon: and it is ſtrange to me, that this ſhould not be diſcerned, that a perſon may be redeemed from the puniſhment due to him for tranſgreſſing the Laws of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and another may be redeemed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40990:76"/>from the puniſhment due to him for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the laws of <hi>England,</hi> and after this it may be ſaid of them both, that they are redeemed from the curſe of the law: but would it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow from thence, that they both lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one and the ſame Law, in all points? in like manner it doth not follow, that becauſe Chriſt hath redeemed both Jews and Gentiles from the curſe of the law, that therefore they both lived under one law in all reſpects, as Mr. <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> imagineth.</p>

               <p>Now I will prove that the whole world by the light of Nature, were under the whole law both of Sacrifices and Ceremonies, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. <hi>No man is juſtified by the Law in the ſight of God,</hi> here the Apoſtle means the whole Ceremonial law, as appears <hi>Heb.</hi> 14.10.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I demanded your Anſwer to that queſtion, whether the Antipodes were under all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, and the people that were in <hi>terra incognita;</hi> and to this you have ſaid nothing, but alledged a text to prove, inſtead of anſwering, which doth not ſpeak a word to your purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Gentiles are bound by the law written in the heart to keep the whole law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> even all the Ceremonies as well as Morals; which you are forced upon, to eſcape the dint of my Argument, which was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40990:76"/>to ſhew you that <hi>Moſes</hi> law did not require the Gentiles to keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Gentiles did not live under it, but without it, as divers texts tell us plainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are three notable things to be obſerved in Mr.</hi> Coppingers <hi>anſwer to this Argument:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, that he is forced to confeſs in words at length, that all the Ceremonies of the Moſaical Law were writ in the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, that this was a force put to ſave his credit, appears, becauſe in his anſwer to Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>his firſt Argument, but two hours before, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, he plainly denyed that which this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forceth him to confeſs: for when he told Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>that the Nations were ſaid to be caſt out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not keep all Iſraels Laws, Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>did ask him, whether the Nations were caſt out for not keeping circumciſion, and other of the Jews ceremonies? And when he ſaw that this Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity was like to fall upon him, he told us, That though the Nations were to keep all Iſraels Statutes, yet (ſaith he) they were not to keep their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. So that though he denyed this in his Anſwer to the firſt Argument, as any one may ſee that looks back to it, yet here he doth confeſs it over and over, that the Nations by the light of Nature were to keep every bit and parcel (for thoſe are his words) of the Ceremonial Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>as well as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, It is obſervable, that a little before, in</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:40990:77"/>page 156. <hi>he cites a text in the ninth of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>to prove that the Jews had the tables of ſtone given them to keep, not onely for themſelves, but that they might convey the things therein required unto the world. Now what need was there for</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>to convey the knowledge of their Laws writ in tables of ſtone to the world, if what he hath ſaid all this while be true,</hi> viz. <hi>that there was no difference? for the very ſame Law (ſaith he) which was in the Jews tables of ſtone, was in the tables of the Gentiles hearts, ſave that one had it written, and the other had not.</hi>

               <p>I prove the Minor thus:</p>
               <p>If there is an Apoſtolical Toleration to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem one day above another, or every day as one is perſwaded, then believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are not bound to eſteem one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:40990:77"/>
               <p>But there is ſuch a Toleration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.</p>
               <p>

               </speaker>
               <p>The ſtrength of Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> his Argument lyeth in the univerſality of the terms <hi>every day;</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſhew that this general term ought to be reſtrained.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance: There ſeems to be as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a toleration given for the eating of all things; and yet Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> believeth eating of blood, and things ſtrangled, and meats offered to Idols, are excepted: in like manner is the ſeventh-day ſabbath to be excepted, when there is a toleration given to obſerve every day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, if every man may walk as he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, then he may keep the ſeventh-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath if he be ſo perſwaded.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer to the laſt firſt: That although I do not deny thoſe the liberty that obſerve the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day ſabbath; yet in as much as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others, and charge others with ſin for not obſerving it; that is their fault: for it is not a mans perſwaſion of the truth of a thing, that will make it my duty; which is the onely point in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> not what is a liberty, but what is a duty.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, whereas Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſaith That all days may be reſtrained, becauſe all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40990:78"/>things are reſtrained by the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore we may not eat all things.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That if Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> can aſſigne as good an exception againſt the term <hi>every day,</hi> as I can againſt his general term <hi>every thing,</hi> I ſhall ſay this Argument is anſwered. Now I will ſhew you, that when the Apoſtle tells us that we may eat all things, the Holy Ghoſt puts a reſtraint here, and tells us, That meats offered in ſacrifice to an Idol, together with blood, and things ſtrangled, are excepted, and may not be eaten, as appears <hi>Act.</hi> 15. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 21. Now if the Holy Ghoſt had ſaid in the caſe of days, You may keep every day alike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſeventh day ſabbath, then there had been ſomewhat in your inſtance, otherwiſe the inſtance confirms the Argument.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Here the Apoſtle doth refer the Obſervation of days to their own mind, and ſo he doth the eating of all things; therefore Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> hath done my work for me, by aſſigning <hi>Acts</hi> 15. where blood, and things ſtrangled, and things offered to Idols, are excepted: If then I ſhew that the ſeventh-day ſabbath is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and particularly excepted, I have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Argument by his own confeſſion: and that it is excepted, you may ſee in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>That which you promiſed, was, That you would ſhew as particular an exception of the ſeventh-day ſabbath out of every day, as I had ſhewn you againſt eating all things; and inſtead thereof, you aſſigne me two general texts, where the whole Law, and every jot and tittle of the Law is required to be kept and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: both which texts have been denyed to include the ſeventh-day ſabbath to be in force, becauſe offering of ſacrifices is required in the fifth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> as well as other things; where Chriſt bids thoſe to whom he preached, to go and be reconciled to their brother, and then come and offer their gift; which Law is not binding to the believers in theſe days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But is it not ſtrange that a man in his right wits ſhould tell us, That he would aſſigne a text where the ſabbath was excepted out of this word</hi> every day, <hi>in as expreſs terms as blood and things ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led are excepted out of</hi> every thing? <hi>and inſtead of a particular exception, he produceth two general texts that have not the leaſt word of a Sabbath in them: but doth not this leave the Argument un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered? for by the ſame rule he can ſay, That the ſeventh-day ſabbath is not intended in this text, when the Apoſtle ſaith, We may obſerve every day alike; I ſay by the ſame rule, and with much more ſtrength of reaſon, it may be denyed that the ſabbath is included in thoſe general terms,</hi> All the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40990:79"/>Law, <hi>and</hi> the whole Law; <hi>but ſure I am, that it was never heard of, that ſuch general texts were ever called expreſs and particular exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a general term in a Syllogiſm by any that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood the difference between a particular and a general term.</hi>

               <p>The texts I named tell us that the whole Law is to be obſerved, and every tittle of it, till it be fulfilled, and the ſeventh-day ſabbath was included; therefore if any man teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, he teacheth contrary to ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And as touching bringing gifts to the Altar, and offering ſacrifices, mentioned in that Text <hi>Matt,</hi> 5. theſe things <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his Croſs<note n="*" place="margin">And lyet when Mr <hi>Ives</hi> did diſpute the next time with Mr. <hi>Coppinger,</hi> he ſaid, That <hi>Altar</hi> was not underſtood for a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Altar; But ſaid, The Altar and the Gift in <hi>Mat. 5.</hi> was both to be underſtood Allegorically: and yet here he doth confeſs that the text ſpeaks of ſuch an Altar and ſuch a Gift that were types of Chriſt, and that ended at his death. Compare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſaying with his Argument upon the fifth of <hi>Matthew</hi> in the next enſuing Diſpute.</note>; if not, they ſhall remain as long as Heaven and Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and ſo muſt the ſeventh-day ſabbath, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> can ſhew us that it is fulfulled by Chriſt, and that becauſe it hath Heaven and Earth for its reaſon.</p>

               <p>All this while there is no particular excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made againſt my former Argument from the fourteenth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as you promiſed me; but inſtead thereof, you repeat the text <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. whence you infer, That Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs, before the law ſhall paſs, till it be fulfilled; of which law, the ſabbath (ſay you) muſt needs be a part. What if that were granted? doth that prove that all the law mentioned in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. is in force? have not you confeſſed that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings mentioned in the ſame chapter, were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and aboliſhed by Chriſt? which very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of yours, hath made the text uncapable to do you that ſervice for which you cited it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For how can any man ſafely conclude any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular propoſition to be binding, from a general text, when he himſelf ſhall ſay, Some things intended in that general text cannot be concluded from it as binding? ſo that the Argument yet remains unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> (viz.) That believers have no tie upon them by vertue of <hi>Moſes</hi> law to obſerve one day above another; and therefore they are not tied by <hi>Moſes</hi> law to keep the ſeventh-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: <hi>And though we have this freedom by Chriſt from the Moſaical inſtitutions, it doth not therefore follow (as ſome fondly do imagine) that therefore we are not to ſet apart a time under the Gospel to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſerve God.

               <p>I ſhall prove that the Tranſlators did well to put in that ſupplement, by ſhewing that the Apoſtle intends ſabbath days. My firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this:</p>

               <p>If you will anſwer my Argument, you muſt ſhew me that the ſeventh-day ſabbath is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this text; but I ſhall by another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument make it appear that ſabbath days is not onely intended in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. but in <hi>Eſay</hi> 1 &amp; 13 alſo; which I thus do:</p>
               <p>Whereſoever this word <hi>ſabbaths</hi> is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with new moons, feaſts and holy days, there the ſeventh-day ſabbath is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

               <p>Therefore the ſeventh-day ſabbath is here intended.</p>
               <p>Shew me but one inſtance where the word <hi>ſabbaths</hi> is joyned with new moons, and feaſts, and holy days, where the ſeventh-day ſabbath is not intended, and then I may have ſome
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40990:85"/>reaſon to think the Apoſtle doth not intend the ſeventh-day ſabbath in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. and if you do ſo, I will give you the caſe.</p>

               <p>If this were true, then the ſabbath muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be joyned with new moons: but I can ſhew you ſabbath mentioned without new moons, that exclude the ſeventh-day ſabbath; and if I do ſo, then I have put in an exception againſt the univerſality of your Argument.</p>

               <p>If you can ſhew me ſabbaths mentioned without new moons, it is not an exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Argument; for I have already ſhewn that the yearly ſabbaths were mentioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out new moons. Again, their feaſts were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ſabbaths,</hi> as the Jubilee and Feaſt of weeks; therefore I muſt tye you to the enumeration in the text and Argument, and do demand an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance where the ſabbath is mentioned with new moons and feaſts, that is not underſtood of the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</p>

               <p>There is in the text an Adjunct of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> Sabbaths, which are ſhadows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if I ſhould ſay, Fetch me my books in ſuch a room, plainly diſtinguiſhing them from other books in other rooms: and ſo theſe ſabbaths are called a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from other ſabbaths that were not ſhadows. Now then
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40990:85"/>Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> muſt ſhew us that the ſeventh-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is a ſhadow of the body of Chriſt, and I will grant the caſe.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>If I prove the ſeventh-day ſabbath a ſhadow of the Body of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſaith he, will grant the caſe; and he hath already granted that the ſabbaths mentioned in this text <hi>Col.</hi> 2. are ſhadows of the Body of Chriſt: it remains then that I prove this word <hi>Sabbaths</hi> to intend the ſeventh-day ſabbath, and then I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the ſeventh-day ſabbath is a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
               <p>The Argument then that I have made alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth prove it; becauſe, as I have ſaid, from the beginning of the Bible to the end of it, where ever ſabbaths are mentioned with new Moons and Feaſts, there the ſeventh-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is always intended: and till Mr. <hi>Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> can ſhew us a text like this of <hi>Col.</hi> 2. where ſabbaths is mentioned with new moons, and the ſeventh-day ſabbath not intended, I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved that the ſeventh-day ſabbath is here intended.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I made an Epithet of the diſtinction in my former anſwer, by ſhewing that the ſabbaths in the text are called <hi>Sabbaths that are a ſhadow,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from ſabbaths that were not ſhadows; and that therefore it could not be meant of ſabbath dayes.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:40990:86"/>
               <p>And ſecondly, I have inſtanced <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.13. where the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> is mentioned with new Moons; and it is not underſtood of the ſeventh day ſabbath, becauſe the work which the text ſaith was done upon thoſe ſabbaths, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the work of the ſeventh-day ſabbaths.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>As for that which you call the Epithet of the diſtinction, though I think it is ſcarce good ſence, yet I ſhall anſwer your meaning, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you that the Sabbaths in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. were not called ſhadows to Diſtinguiſh them from the ſeventh-day Sabbath, as if that was no ſhadow, becauſe the ſeventh-day it ſelf is called a ſigne, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. even as circumciſion was called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Again, it doth not follow, becauſe he ſaith Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths that are a ſhadow, that he excludes ſome Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths that were not ſhadows, no more then when he ſaith new Moons that are a ſhadow, that he doth hereby intimate that ſome new Moons were not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as touching the text <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.13. where you ſay Sabbaths are mentioned with new Moons; which could not be underſtood of the ſabbath dayes, becauſe (ſay you) there was ſuch work to be done which was contrary to the work of a ſabbath day.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that nothing is mentioned which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> lawfully done on thoſe ſabbaths, that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

               </speaker>
               <p>I ſhall ſhew you that theſe ſabbaths in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.13. could not be the ſabbath days: as firſt, they are ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. to tread in Gods Courts in the Temple, which they did not do on the ſabbath dayes, for then they met in the Synagogue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, here is all the Sacrifices and burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which they could not offer upon the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Firſt, it doth not follow that all thoſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties mentioned with the ſabbaths, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. were to be performed upon the ſabbath dayes, any more then the celebrations of their new Moons were to be celebrated upon the ſabbath dayes; and therefore if the duties there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, could not be performed upon the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath dayes, that doth not prove the ſabbaths mentioned with new Moons in that text, doth not intend the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you ſay they trod the Courts of God: this you call a work which they could not do upon the ſabbath dayes, becauſe you ſay they met in the Synagogue upon ſabbath dayes.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That <hi>David</hi> magnifies the <hi>CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RTS</hi> of Gods houſe, while as yet there was no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which ſhews that other places were called the Courts of Gods houſe, as well as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:40990:87"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, they might tread Gods Courts in the Temple upon the Sabbath dayes, and therefore you confeſſed that the prieſts in the Temple might offer the Sacrifice upon the ſabbath-day, and be blameleſs, which Chriſt ſuppoſes to be their conſtant cuſtome; but I believe never any ſeventh-day ſabbath-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but Mr.</hi> Coppinger, <hi>ever taught that it was a work that could not be done on the Sabbath day, for People to tread in the Courts of Gods Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, you ſay here was ALL their Burnt-offerings, and ALL their Sacrifices, which you ſay could not be upon the ſeventh day ſabbath offered, and therefore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> could not mean the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That the text doth not ſay all their Sacrifices, but the multitude of their Sacrifices; and therefore you groſly abuſe the text: Juſt as if I ſhould ſay, Here is a multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here aſſembled; doth it reaſonably follow from ſuch a ſpeech, that ALL the People in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are here aſſembled?</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>The text ſpeaks of their SOLEMN Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, which was not wont to be upon their ſabbath dayes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>It doth not follow, that becauſe they were ſolemn Aſſemblies, that they were ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies that could not be upon the ſabbath days;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40990:87"/>for Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> meets upon the ſeventh-day ſabbath, and will they ſay when they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is not a ſolemn Aſſembly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if the Sabbaths mentioned</hi> Iſa. 1.13. <hi>could not be the Sabbath dayes, becauſe they had ſolemn Aſſemblies upon it, then the ſeventh-day Sabbath that Mr.</hi> Coppinger <hi>and thoſe of his mind aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles on, is not the true Sabbath day, becauſe they have a ſolemn Aſſembly upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I have ſhewed that the mentioning of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Sabbaths, doth not prove they were all to be performed upon the Sabbath there mentioned: but however, that is moſt untrue, to ſay that the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath mentioned</hi> Iſa. 1.13. <hi>is not the Sabbath day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe ſervices there mentioned could not be done upon the ſabbath days, and that thoſe religious duties there mentioned, were contrary to the works of the Sabbath day, then which nothing is more falſe.</hi>

               <p>I have ſhewn you a text where ſabbaths is mentioned with new Moons, that is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I ſhall leave this Argument to the judgement of the Audience and your own conſcience; I have ſhewn that ſabbaths were ſhadows of Chriſt, and therefore not binding in theſe days, to the believing Gentiles: I have alſo given two reaſons why the ſabbath mentioned <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. is to be underſtood of the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:40990:88"/>
               <p>The one was, becauſe the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways underſtood for the ſeventh-day ſabbath, when it is mentioned without reference to their feſtival ſabbaths.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, I have more chiefly inſiſted and do ſtill inſiſt upon this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day ſabbath is intended by the Apoſtle, in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. becauſe ſabbath is there mentioned with new Moons and Feaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Bible, where-ever ſabbaths is mentioned with new Moons and Feaſts, there the ſabbath dayes are always intended; and therefore I do again call upon my Reſpondent either to ſay that he cannot anſwer the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe to ſhew me a text where ſabbaths are mentioned with new Moons, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day ſabbath not intended, becauſe no Scripture is of a private interpretation.</p>

               <p>The firſt Argument I ſhall urge, is this:</p>
               <p>If all believing Gentiles are bound to keep the royal Law in the ſecond of <hi>James,</hi> then all believing Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>But all believing Gentiles are bound to keep the royal Law in the ſecond of <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I deny the conſequence of the major Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: for though all believers are bound to keep the royal Law mentioned in <hi>James</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, yet they are not bound to keep the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath.</p>

               <p>I deny the Syllogiſm, becauſe you do not conclude that which was denyed; for this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſhould have concluded, that if all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles are bound to keep the royal Law in the ſecond of <hi>James,</hi> that THEN it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that they are bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath: which was the conſequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed in the Major Propoſition of the former Argument.</p>

               <p>Sir, I wonder you ſhould pretend to diſpute Syllogiſtically, and yet make two Syllogiſms
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40990:90"/>that conclude not the Major propoſition deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt Syllogiſm: however, becauſe I would not ſpend time about trifles, I ſhall anſwer this Argument by denying the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Major Propoſition; for though the royal Law mentioned in the ſecond of <hi>James</hi> be the whole of that Law which in the Scriptures prohibiteth murder and adultery, yet it doth not follow that the ſeventh day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is a point or a part of it, becauſe every Law which in the Scripture prohibiteth murder and adultery, doth not command the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For murder was by the Law given to</hi> Noah <hi>prohibited, and ſo was adultery, and yet the ſeventh day ſabbath was no point or part of it: ſo that a man may keep the royal Law, which in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture prohibits murder and adultery, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> keep the ſeventh day ſabbath; for all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes <hi>kept that royal Law which in the Scriptures prohibits murder and adultery, and yet never any of them kept the ſeventh day ſabbath.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For the whole Law may be mentioned where the

                  </gap> many words, then I may uſher in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Laws; for <hi>whole Law</hi> is never mentioned (as I have ſaid) where the ceremonial Law is verbally excluded: but doth it follow that therefore it is included?</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I ſay again, if the Scripture no where ſpeaks of <hi>whole Law,</hi> and excludes the ſeventh day, then it includes it.</p>

               <p>I have denyed the Conſequence over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and have aſſigned the reaſon why I do ſo, and yet you make no anſwer to it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Argument was, That the ſeventh day ſabbath was a part of that Law which in the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40990:91"/>Scriptures forbiddeth murder and adultery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>And I have anſwered to that Argument, by ſhewing, that though the ſeventh day ſabbath might be commanded in a Law that forbiddeth murder and adultery; yet it followeth not that every Law that in the Scripture forbiddeth murder and adultery, doth command the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>It doth command it; if it doth not exclude it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Pray let us have ſome Argument to prove, without repeating the ſame things over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for I have told you That it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the word <hi>whole Law</hi> doth include the ſeventh day ſabbath, becauſe it doth not in ſo many words exclude it; for one may as well ſay the word <hi>whole Law</hi> includeth the obſervation of ſacrifices and offerings, becauſe thoſe things are not excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if any ſhall ſay, That ſacrifices are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in other texts, becauſe the ceremonies of the Law were called</hi> ſhadows, Heb. 10.1. <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That in another text the ſabbath day is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſame reaſon, becauſe the ſabbath day is called a</hi> ſhadow, Col. 2.16, 17.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Coppinger,</hi> I ſuppoſe it remains for you to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40990:92"/>prove, that where-ever the words <hi>whole Law</hi> and <hi>royal Law</hi> are mentioned in the Scripture, that the ſeventh day ſabbath is included, if it be not excluded.</p>

               <p>I have called for an inſtance of Mr. <hi>Ives,</hi> and he hath not given any, where the ſeventh day is excluded from the word <hi>whole Law.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>I have told you, That if I could not ſhew a text where the ſeventh day is excluded, yet the Conſequence doth not follow, <hi>That therefore the ſeventh day ſabbath is included; as in the caſe of the Paſſover, and other Judaical Rites, it doth not follow that where theſe are not verbally exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the word</hi> whole Law, <hi>that therefore they are included, and enjoyned where-ever the whole Law is required to be obſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further, I ſay the ſabbath is not included in the Law mentioned <hi>James</hi> the ſecond: and do you prove it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Sir, I am Reſpondent, and the Reſpondent cannot beg the Queſtion in denying, but rather you do beg the Queſtion by affirming the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath is intended and commanded in the ſecond of <hi>James,</hi> which you cannot prove.</p>

               <p>If you deny the ſeventh day ſabbath is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the ſecond of <hi>James,</hi> you may deny it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I do not deny it becauſe I will deny it, but I will deny it becauſe I have reaſon to deny it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Well then, I will prove that the ſeventh day ſabbath is commanded in this text <hi>James</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, thus:</p>
               <p>If the Law in this text <hi>James</hi> the ſecond, be the whole of that Law which in the old Teſtament forbiddeth blaſphemy, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and adultery, (for unto that Law the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> alludeth when he ſaith, <hi>We muſt fulfil it according to the Scriptures</hi>) then the ſeventh day ſabbath is included and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this Law mentioned in this text <hi>James</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>But the Law in this text <hi>James</hi> the ſecond, is the whole of that Law which in the Scriptures of the old Teſtament forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth blaſphemy, murder and adultery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſeventh day ſabbath is included and required in this Law mentioned in this text <hi>James</hi> the ſecond.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, by ſhewing that I may deny the Syllogiſm, becauſe it concludes not that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40990:93"/>which was formerly denyed: for it is no more then what we have had over and over, ſave that now inſtead of the word <hi>Scripture</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllogiſm, you add the <hi>Scriptures of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I further anſwer by denying the Conſequence; for though the Law mentioned in the ſecond of <hi>James</hi> be the Law which in the old Teſtament forbiddeth blaſphemy, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and adultery, yet it doth not follow, that every thing muſt be obſerved by the believing Gentiles, that the Law in the old Teſtament requireth; as for inſtance: That Law in the old Teſtament that forbids murder and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, did alſo command them that they ſhould circumciſe their Children, and offer Sacrifices. Theſe were parts of that whole Law which in the Scriptures of the old Teſtament forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth murder and adultery, as appears <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>For I teſtifie to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the WHOLE LAW.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now who can deny but this whole Law did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid murder and adultery? But though we muſt abſtain from theſe according to the Law of Nature and Chriſt, doth it therefore follow that we muſt obſerve every part of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, as that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſeth? For is not circumciſing called a part of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law?</hi> John 7.23. <hi>and ſacrificing is called a part of that Law,</hi> Mat. 8.4, <hi>and is not honouring the father and mother called</hi> Moſes <hi>Law?</hi> Mark 7.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now may not a man as well reaſon thus: If we muſt keep all that Law which in the old Testament Forbiddeth murder, and adultery, and diſobedience to parents, then we muſt keep circumciſion, and offering of ſacrifices; for theſe are parts of that whole Law, of which the Law that forbiddeth murder and adultery, and diſobedience to Parents, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> a part? I ſay, is not this the ſame with Mr.</hi> Coppinger? <hi>we muſt keep ALL that Law (ſaith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </speaker>
               <p>I will prove that the whole Law in this text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. doth exclude Ceremonies, thus:</p>
               <p>If the whole Law there mentioned, be that Law that Chriſtians were to preach and practiſe, then it doth exclude Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>But the whole Law mentioned in this text <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. is that whole Law that Chriſtians were to preach and practiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Law mentioned in this text doth exclude Ceremonies.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>If it excludeth ceremonies, then it exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth your former Argument, which ſaith, We are bound to keep the whole of that Law, which in the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament did forbid murder and adultery; and alſo it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40990:94"/>your interpretation of <hi>whole Law,</hi> in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>For we cannot keep the whole Law, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, in an old Teſtament ſence, but we muſt obſerve the ceremonial as well as the moral part: for the old Teſtament law, in which murder and adultery were forbidden, had ceremonies commanded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; ſo that you have confuted your ſelf.</p>

               <p>I argue further:</p>
               <p>If Chriſtian Gentiles are bound to keep the whole Royal Law, as it is laid down in this text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. then they are bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>But Chriſtian Gentiles are bound to keep the whole Royal Law, as it is laid down in this text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſtian Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>This Argument contains two Parts:</p>
               <p>The one is, That Chriſtian Gentiles are bound to keep this law, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The other is, That this Law contains the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſpeaks to Chriſtians in general, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Gentiles, Becauſe he calls them Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40990:96"/>and writeth to them as Believers, and tells them, that if they kept the Royal Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcripture, they ſhould do well; and withal, tells them, that <hi>whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That the ſeventh day ſabbath was a point of this Law, I thus reaſon:</p>
               <p>If the Apoſtle refers them to the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, and they could not keep the Law according to the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except they keep the ſeventh day ſabbath, then the ſeventh day ſabbath is one point of this law, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle refers them to the ſcriptures of the old Teſtament, and they could not keep the law, according to the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs they kept the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I have anſwered to this Argument over and over, and therefore I ſhall take a little time to ſpeak a few words more, and then I ſhall deſire we may go to a freſh Argument.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, this word <hi>whole Law,</hi> it either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the whole Law that the Jews were to obſerve, or the whole Law that Chriſtians are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40990:97"/>to obſerve: if the whole Law here, reſpect the Law that the Jews were to obſerve, then if we ſhould be bound to that, we ſhould be bound to obſerve Ceremonies, as well as Morals; for thus <hi>whole Law</hi> is underſtood, both in the Old and New Teſtament, when it relates to the Laws the Jews were to keep, as appears, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. compared with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.8. where God tells Iſrael, that he <hi>will never remove them, if they will keep the WHOLE law, with the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, This word <hi>whole law,</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Law of liberty, which believers are to keep, which is oppoſed to the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as appears by comparing <hi>James</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 25. with <hi>James</hi> 2 and 12, where he bids them ſo ſpeak and ſo do, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s thoſe that ſhould be judged by the Law of liberty, which is oppoſed to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for that it is called a yoke of bondage. So that here is not one word of the ſeventh day ſabbath; but indeed of a royal Law, and a Law of liberty, which Chriſtians are bound to keep according to the Scriptures, in doing by all men as they would be done unto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for what Law ſoever Chriſt hath commended and confirmed to us out of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, theſe laws indeed we muſt keep according to the Scriptures of the old Teſtament: but Chriſt hath not confirmed the Saturday ſabbath, and therefore we are not to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40990:97"/>look into the old Teſtament for our informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein.</p>
               <p>

               <p>If Chriſtian Jews are bound to keep the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath, and there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Chriſtian Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Gentiles, then all Chriſtian Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>

               <p>It is both in the 15 of the <hi>Acts</hi> and 21 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and I can aſſigne other places: but firſt, I ſay it is in <hi>Acts</hi> the 21. &amp; 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>verſes;</hi> the words are theſe: <hi>Thou ſeeſt brother, how many thouſands of the Jews there are which BELIEVE, and they are all zealous of the Law. And they are informed of thee, that thou teacheſt all the Jew; which are among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to forſake Moſes, ſaying, That they ought not to circumciſe their children, neither to walk after the cuſtoms. What is it therefore? the multitude muſt needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we ſay to thee: We have four men which have a vow upon them, them take, and purifie they ſelf, and be at char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with them, that they may ſhave their heads: and all may know that thoſe things whereof they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning thee are nothing, but that thou thy ſelf alſo walkeſt orderly, and keepest the law. But as touching the Gentiles which believe, we have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and concluded, that they obſerve no ſuch things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:40990:99"/>
               <p>Whence I obſerve theſe two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that here was an Injunction laid upon <hi>Paul</hi> and other believing Jews, that was not laid upon the believing Gentiles: that they were <hi>believing Jews, ſee verſe</hi> 20. that this Injunction was not laid upon believing Gentiles, ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 25. where the Gentiles that believe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden ſuch Obſervations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe were no mean perſons that did enjoyn theſe things, but they were a holy Convocation of Apoſtles and Elders, among whom the Holy Ghoſt was preſident, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 21 &amp; 25. So that if ever there was an unerring Council in the world, this was one, who were guided by the Holy Ghoſt that was ſent to lead into all truth: and therefore it is horrible preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to think that theſe did erre; and yet theſe do enjoyn ſuch things upon the believing Jews, that they expreſly charge the believing Gentiles not to obſerve.</p>

               <p>Theſe Jews that they adviſe him to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend unto, they were ſuch as had conſpired the death of <hi>Paul;</hi> and therefore in point of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, they adviſe him to condeſcend unto them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this could not be a precept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the text ſaith, That they offered an Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring according to the Law, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. now to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40990:99"/>enjoyn ſuch a thing as this, would be to deny Chriſt come in the Fleſh; and therefore it was no other then a prudent advice that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Elders gave to <hi>Paul</hi> to ſave his life from thoſe Jews that had conſpired his death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If the words to the Jews, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. are but a bare advice, then we may ſay ſo of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to the Gentiles, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. and of all others that we like not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas you ſay, They were Jews that did conſpire <hi>Pauls</hi> death, and therefore they adviſed <hi>Paul</hi> thus to do to ſave himſelf from their malice and fury; I anſwer, that theſe were believing Jews that were zealous of the Law, and not thoſe unbelieving Jews that went about to kill him, <hi>verſe</hi> 31. which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Jews went about to kill him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this condeſcention to the Law; therefore the condeſcention was for the ſake of the Jews that believed, and not for the ſake of thoſe that conſpired his death.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, whereas he ſaith the Apoſtles did adviſe <hi>Paul</hi> to condeſcend, but did not enjoyn it, for if they had enjoyned him to obſerve the Law of purification, then they did enjoyn him to do thoſe things which by conſequence did deny Chriſt come in the fleſh. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that according to Mr. <hi>Coppingers</hi> Notion upon the text, they did ADVISE <hi>Paul</hi> to do
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40990:100"/>that which by conſequence did deny Chriſt come in the fleſh; and ſo the abſurdity falls nigh-hand as heavy upon him, as he would make it to fall upon me; for is it not a great piece of wickedneſs for any body to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or to take advice (ſuppoſing it to be but a bare advice) which by conſequence denies Chriſt come in the fleſh, meerly to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from perſecution? Now therefore, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing with Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> that it is but an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which the Apoſtles and Elders give <hi>Paul,</hi> I demand whether it be a good or a bad advice.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Queſtion Mr.</hi> Ives <hi>put over and over to Mr.</hi> Coppinger; <hi>who though he ſaid that it was but an advice which the Apoſtles and Elders gave to</hi> Paul, <hi>yet he would not anſwer whether it was a good or a bad advice.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>If I ſhould grant that this WAS a precept that the Apoſtles and Elders gave to <hi>Paul,</hi> yet this doth not prove that there IS NOW a difference in point of precept, though there was then; for my Argument ſpeaketh of the preſent tenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there IS no difference between the believing Jews and believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in point of precept, and this text onely ſpeaks of what WAS.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Moderator.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, the Scripture ought to be our rule, and I humbly conceive that we know not what is a duty but by reading of the Scriptures, and therein finde what was a duty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Firſt, I anſwer to Mr. <hi>Coppinger,</hi> by ſhewing him that in his Argument he told us that there was no difference between believing Jews and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40990:101"/>believing Gentiles in point of precept, either in <hi>Acts</hi> 15 or <hi>Acts</hi> 21. So that if this precept was but for that age, or for that particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, yet I have confuted his Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Argument ſaith <hi>Acts</hi> 15 and <hi>Acts</hi> 21. aſſignes no difference.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this precept was to bind Jews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like circumſtances to the worlds end, which under no circumſtance could bind the Gentiles, becauſe the Apoſtles and Elders by the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit, did expreſly charge the Gentiles to obſerve no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how far the obſervation of the Law of <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> was a type of Chriſt, I am not ſo well acquainted with it, as to give an exact account; yet this I know, That when it was moſt in force, it was but a voluntary ſervice, as appears <hi>Num.</hi> 6. So that if any man would be a <hi>Nazarene,</hi> he muſt take a vow to perform the Law of the <hi>Nazarites;</hi> not that any body was bound to be a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> any more then <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife were bound to ſell all their Eſtates for to lay at the Apoſtles feet, for to be diſpoſed for the common good of the Church; yet having made ſuch a dedication voluntarily, they were bound neceſſarily to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> having a vow upon him at <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shrea,</hi> was afterwards under a Law to perform it, and ſo were thoſe other Votaries mentioned with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. which vow the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40990:101"/>Apoſtles and Elders enjoyn them to diſcharge, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. but do expreſly forbid the Gentiles the obſervation of any ſuch thing: therefore I have ſhewn that here was ſomething enjoyned upon the Jews, that was not enjoyned upon the Gentiles.</p>

               <p>I do ſay, This was but an advice, and that it was no preept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereupon one that was a Hearer at this Diſpute handed up a Note to Mr.</hi> Ives, <hi>wherein he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Mr.</hi> Coppinger <hi>did confeſs at</hi> Worceſter Houſe <hi>that thoſe words about which the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie did depend,</hi> Acts 21.24, 25. <hi>were binding precepts, though he now ſaid they were not precepts but advice.</hi>

               <p>I never ſaid the words in the 24 <hi>verſe,</hi> where the Apoſtles and Elders bid <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe men with him, purifie themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, I never ſaid thoſe were precepts; but indeed I ſaid that the words in the 25 <hi>verſe</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, where the Gentiles are expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the doing of any ſuch thing. I ſay, theſe indeed are precepts, and binding to believing Gentiles.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Sir, you have granted enough to confute your Argument: for admit the words to the Jews in the 24 <hi>verſe</hi> are no precept, but an advice, as
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40990:102"/>you call it, yet you have confeſſed that the 25 <hi>verſe</hi> is a binding Law to the Gentiles, that they ſhould do NO SUCH THING. Well then, by your own confeſſion, the Gentiles are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to do that which the Jews are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to do; and therefore there is a difference in point of precept, and your Argument is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, that ſaith, There is no difference: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall deſire that the <hi>Moderator</hi> would call for a freſh Argument.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Moderator.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I think enough hath been ſaid to this Argument, and therefore my advice is, that you would proceed to another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>All believing Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath, I thus prove:</p>
               <p>If it be the Doctrine of the new Teſtament, that Gods people ought to keep the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath, then all believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ought to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath</p>
               <p>But it is the Doctrine of the New Teſtament that Gods people ought to keep the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> all believing Gentiles ought to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I pray what do you mean by the terms <hi>Gods people</hi> in your Argument? becauſe the Jews are called <hi>Gods people</hi> by way of diſtinction from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people.</p>
            </sp>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:40990:102"/>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Coppinger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I mean ſuch as are bound to hear every word, and to obſerve the principles of Religion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead works, and faith towards God, with the Doctrine of Baptiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If you mean all Gods people, and all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers without exception, then there is no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in the Syllogiſm, for then the Argument runs thus: If all Gods people are required, then they are all required.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Coppinger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I then argue thus:</p>
               <p>If the Church of the Hebrews, by vertue of this Epiſtle to the Hebrews, were bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath, then all believing Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>But the Church of the Hebrews, by vertue of this Epiſtle to the Hebrews, were bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> all believing Gentiles are bound to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer: Firſt, if by <hi>Church of the Hebrews</hi> you mean Jews, then it is but the ſame with the Argument we laſt diſpatched, for then you ſaid, If the believing Jews were commanded, then the believing Gentiles were commanded.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, if you mean Gentiles, then I
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40990:103"/>anſwer as before, That there is no medium in the Syllogiſm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Coppinger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I mean onely that very Church as they were a particular Congregation, diſtinguiſhed from all other Churches, and then there is a medium, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If that Church were commanded to keep the ſeventh day, then believing Churches are commanded to keep the ſeventh day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>But that Church was commanded to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>Therefore, all Believers, and all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are required and commanded to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>And ſo conſequently, all believing Gentiles.</p>

               <p>I do deny both Major and Minor; for both Propoſitions are juſtly to be excepted againſt.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Coppinger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I have two things to do; the firſt is, to prove that the Church of the Hebrews were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath; and the ſecond thing is, That if this Church was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath, that then all believing Gentiles were commanded to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath: which two things I ſhall prove.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the text faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. <hi>That there
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40990:103"/>remaineth a keeping of a ſabbath to the people of God,</hi> for ſo it is read in your Margent; here then, is a ſabbath commanded, and the third verſe tells us, that this was not commanded onely for the Hebrews, but for Believers in general, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>He that believeth, hath entered into reſt:</hi> and that this was the ſeventh day reſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe the text ſaith, <hi>He ceaſeth from his own works, as God did from his:</hi> now God ceaſed the ſeventh day from his works, as the text tells us, verſ.4. therefore he doth admoniſh them to take heed that they did not fall, after the ſame example of diſobedience, in breaking the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as the Iſraelites fell in the Wilderneſs; therefore if you read Chap. 2. verſ. 15, 16, 17. you will find with whom he was grieved forty years, <hi>was it not thoſe whoſe Carcaſes fell in the wilderneſſe?</hi> and that they fell for breaking the ſeventh day ſabbath, appears <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.12, 13. <hi>Moreover alſo, I gave them my ſabbath, to be a ſigne between me and them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the 13 verſe) <hi>the houſe of Iſrael rebelled againſt me in the wilderneſs</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and my ſabbath they greatly pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted; then I ſaid, I will pour out my fury upon them in the wilderneſs to conſume them:</hi> and ver. 15. <hi>I lifted up my hand againſt them in the wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>becauſe they deſpiſed my Judgements, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not in my Statutes, but polluted my Sabbaths.</hi> And therefore <hi>David</hi> admoniſheth them in his time not to harden their hearts as in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40990:104"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7. but while it was called, <hi>To day,</hi> to hear his voice, and not harden their hearts: ſo here, the Author to the Hebrews tells them there remains the keeping of a ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath for them and all believers; but doth bid them take heed of Iſraels ſins in the wilderneſs, which you ſee was Sabbath-breaking, as well as other ſins, leſt, as the eleventh verſe ſaith, <hi>they fall after the ſame example of unbelief,</hi> or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I ſhall ſhew that you have wholly miſtaken the text.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, you are to prove a reſt or ſabbath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and this text ſpeaks of a reſt that is promiſed, as appears verſ 1. of Chap. 4. where the Author to the Hebrews bids them <hi>fear, leſt A PROMISE being left of entering into his Reſt, any ſhould ſeem to come ſhort through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the text, from the Greek, ought rather to be read <hi>A Sabbatiſm,</hi> then <hi>the keeping of a Sabbath:</hi> however, the word is not SAB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BATH DAY; and when I did diſpute with you laſt, you would not allow that the word <hi>ſabbaths</hi> in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. ſhould be underſtood of a <hi>ſabbath day,</hi> though there was good reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it ſo, becauſe the word day was not in the Original, though it was in the Engliſh Text: but here you will have it to be underſtood of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40990:104"/>
                  <hi>ſabbath day,</hi> though the word be neither in the Engliſh nor Greek text, and though there be no reaſon why you ſhould ſo notion it. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this reſt is not a reſt commanded, or a ſeventh day ſabbath reſt, becauſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath, unbelievers and their cattel might have injoyed; but the reſt here promiſed, is reſerved onely for believers, which none elſe ſhall ſhare in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the reſt here ſpoken of, is a reſt that <hi>Joſhua</hi> could not give them; but he did give them the ſeventh day reſt, therefore this could not be ſpoken of the ſeventh day: ſee for this purpoſe the eighth verſe of this fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where it is ſaid, that <hi>if Joſhua had given them reſt, he would not afterwards have ſpoken of another day;</hi> and then adds, that <hi>there remaines THEREFORE a reſt to the people of God,</hi> verſ. 9. Therefore? Wherefore? the eighth verſe tells us, becauſe <hi>Joſhua</hi> did not give them reſt: ſo that this, if it prove any thing, it proves againſt Mr. <hi>Coppinger,</hi> becauſe it ſuppoſes ſome other day, then what they enjoyed in the time of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, whereas Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> tells us, That it muſt be meant of the ſeventh day ſabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the text ſaith, <hi>He that believeth ceaſeth from his own work as God did from his;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, That this doth not prove a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for a man to forbear working upon the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40990:105"/>ſeventh day; but it ſhews rather, the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that men ſhall enjoy through believing, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhall reſt from their labours: ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that LABOUR, and I will give you reſt,</hi> Mat. 11.28. and verſ. 29 Chriſt promiſes that <hi>they ſhall find REST to their ſouls;</hi> and, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, that die in the Lord, for they REST from their LABOURS, and their works follow them,</hi> Rev. 13.14. in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Author to the Hebrews would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, when he tells us that he that doth believe, hath ceaſed from his labour, as God did from his.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, though the Author to the Hebrews al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth to the ſeventh day, upon which God reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet this doth not prove that therefore we muſt enter into the Jewiſh or ſeventh day reſt; no more then it proves we muſt enter into the Literal <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe he alludeth alſo to that Literal <hi>Canaan</hi> in which <hi>Joſhua</hi> conducted <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> but he rather informs them, that as they under the Law had a time of reſt, and a place of reſt, ſo they that did believe ſhould have a day of Grace, and a place of Glory, in which they ſhould be like God, in reſt for ever, never to labour more, even as God reſted and wrought no more, when he had ended his ſix dayes work: therefore he bids them <hi>LABO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R to enter into his reſt;</hi> but the ſeventh day reſt they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into without labour.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:40990:105"/>
               <p>Seventhly, whereas Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> tells us, that the Author to the Hebrews exhorts, that we ſhould not fall after the ſame example of unbelief and diſobedience that the Iſraelites fell into, in the wilderneſs, which (ſaith he) was ſabbath-breaking, as appears by <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.16. as well as other ſins, therefore (ſaith he) by the ſame example, muſt be underſtood that he cautions them to beware of breaking the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, That this is a ſtraining the text; for it doth not follow that he doth admoniſh the Chriſtians to beware of the ſame particular ſins, as Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> would notion it; but of ſins in general: for firſt, we cannot be guilty of loathing Manna, nor of murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the waters of <hi>Meribah;</hi> and yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. That <hi>THESE were for our examples,</hi> &amp;c. So in like manner we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be guilty of ſin in not obſerving the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath, any more then we can be guilty of loathing Manna; and yet Gods judgments upon them for all their old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſins, are ſet forth to us for examples, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Again, the Apoſtle gives the like Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40990:106"/>wait upon the altar, ſhould live of the altar? even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they that preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> May not a man as reaſonably infer from hence, that becauſe the maintenance of the Levitical prieſthood is here ſet forth as an example to teach us to take care of Goſpel-Miniſters, that therefore they muſt be maintained after the ſame manner as the Prieſts were maintained that waited upon the Altar, as Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> may ſay, Becauſe Gods Judgments againſt Iſraels ſins in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are ſet forth to us for examples, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we, who are believing Gentiles under the Goſpel, (to avoid the like Judgements) muſt do all the Commandments, and believe all the promiſes that Iſrael ſuffered his diſpleaſure for in the Wilderneſs, for not obeying and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>Having thus anſwered you Paraphraſe upon the text, I do again call upon you to prove that the <hi>Reſt</hi> or <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath which we are commanded to obſerve; for the ſum of my Anſwer is, that this is a Reſt promiſed, and not a Reſt or ſeventh day ſabbath commanded: therefore pray let us have an Argument for the proof of it.</p>

               <p>But Chriſt in his Sermon upon the Mount did

               <p>I tell you, Sir, that this is not fair arguing, when both Propoſitions are juſtly to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: however, I deny the Conſequence; for it doth not follow that if Chriſt did preach the ſeventh day ſabbath upon the Mount, that therefore all believing Gentiles are bound to obſerve it; for I ſhall ſhew ſome things that Chriſt commanded to be obſerved upon the Mount, that Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> himſelf ſaith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles are not bound to obſerve.</p>

               <p>If all that Chriſt taught upon the Mount, and commanded others to teach, was to abide as long as the Sun and Moon, and Heaven and Earth remain, then all the believing Gentiles are bound to obſerve all that Chriſt taught upon the Mount.</p>

               <p>That I ſhall do; therefore pray look into <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23, 24. Chriſt there commands that a man ſhould leave his gift at the Altar, and go and be reconciled to his brother, and then Chriſt commands him to come and offer his gift: theſe are commands given upon the Mount.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are ſuch commands as he bids others to do and teach, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. for they were to do and teach the leaſt of thoſe commandments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe commands that are taught upon the Mount are not all in force to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentiles, becauſe that command of leaving the gift at the Altar, and coming to offer it upon the Altar, is not now in force: therefore all that Chriſt commanded in his Sermon upon the Mount is not of force to believing Gentiles.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>I anſwer to the laſt firſt; that Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> doth abuſe Interpreters, or elſe he never read any; for I challenge him to ſhew me any one Interpreter that ever underſtood <hi>altar</hi> and <hi>gift</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. allegorically. It is true, that they ſometimes make a ſpiritual application of theſe words; but they all with one conſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words literally.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Mr. <hi>Coppinger</hi> hath ſhewed us that <hi>altar</hi> and <hi>gift</hi> is variouſly underſtood; but hath not, out of this variety, told us which of theſe ſenſes ſhould be put upon <hi>altar</hi> and <hi>gift</hi> in this fifth of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thirdly, I do challenge Mr. <hi>Coppinger,</hi> or any man elſe, to ſhew me that a <hi>gift</hi> at the altar is ever underſtood allegorically throughout the Scriptures, from the Creation of the world to the death of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, that Chriſt doth here intend a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral altar, appears, if we do but conſider <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.4. where we ſhall finde that what Chriſt taught upon the Mount, he exhorts the man that was cured of his Leproſie to obſerve; for as ſoon as Chriſt deſcended from the Mount, he cleans'd
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40990:108"/>the Leper, and then commanded him to offer a gift as <hi>Moſes</hi> had commanded; which could not be underſtood allegorically.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This Chriſt bid the Leper do, that it might be a Teſtimony of him to the Prieſt, that ſo if the Prieſt ſhould ask him how he was cleanſed, or who did cleanſe him, he might hereby have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to teſtifie Chriſt unto the Prieſt, and tell him that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> made him whole<note n="*" place="margin">This cannot be the true ſence of the Lepers ſhewing himſelf to the Prieſt for a Teſtimony, but rather it was in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law which did command the Lepers to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Prieſt, that the Prieſt having view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Leper, he might give a Teſtimony to the people, That this man was now fit to go abroad, who before had dwelt in an out-houſe: See <hi>Lev. 14.</hi>

               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:40990:109"/>
               <p>But ſecondly, whereas you ſay that this text <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.4. ſpeaks of a <hi>gift,</hi> but not an <hi>altar;</hi> I anſwer, that I never heard that the Prieſt in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law did ever offer a gift without an altar: my reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.19. That <hi>the altar ſanctifieth the gift:</hi> therefore this <hi>gift</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. muſt needs be a gift to be offered upon an Altar, as well as that gift ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</p>

               <p>I pray Sir, confeſs your Errour for ſhame; for is it not a ſhame for you to to tell us, that Chriſt commanded the Leper to offer his Gift without an Altar, when Chriſt bid him offer it as <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded? and when you turned to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> did you not ſay, the Prieſt was to offer without an Altar? and now I ſhew you that the Prieſt did offer upon the Altar, for the clenſing of the Leper, you put it off, and tell me, What if there were an Altar? it is not to your purpoſe; why did you not ſay ſo at firſt, and ſave us this labour? but give me leave to tell you again, that it is to my purpoſe to ſhew you the Errour of your Argument: for if Chriſt commands the Leper to obſerve all thoſe ceremonial obſervations for his clenſing, then is your Argument falſe, that ſaith, All things that Chriſt commanded us in his Sermon upon the Mount, all believing Gentiles are bound to obſerve to the end of the world; but you ſay this that Chriſt commands the Leper to do, was not on the Mount, but as ſoon as he came off the Mount, &amp; this (you ſay) is nothing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40990:110"/>to <hi>Gift</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. in his Sermon upon the Mount. I anſwer, That the difference in places, eſpecially ſo little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as between Chriſts being on the Mount, and off from the Mount, could not make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in his commands. Secondly, it cannot reaſonably be imagined, that Chriſt would command the Leper to do any thing when he came off the Mount, that was contradictory to what he did command when he was upon the Mount; therefore I have great reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Altar that he commands them to offer their Gift on, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. in his Sermon upon the Mount, is the material Altar, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which he bids the Leper offer his Gift on, as ſoon as he comes off from the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. and this I the rather believe, becauſe that there is no text from the beginning of the Bible to the death of the Meſſiah, that ſpeaks of an allegorical Altar.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40990:111"/>the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, then it is of force ſtill.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>SIR, I wonder that you make Arguments that have not one true Propoſition in them; for this is like the laſt, both Propoſitions being falſe: however, prove the Minor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is obſervable, that Mr.</hi> Coppinger, <hi>in the laſt Diſpute before this, did affirm, That all the Gentiles were bound to keep all the ceremonies of the Law of</hi> Moſes: <hi>now then if this be a good Argument why we muſt keep the ſeventh day ſabbath now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were to keep it before the death of Christ, then we muſt be circumciſed and offer ſacrifices, for the ſame reaſon, becauſe he himſelf did confeſs that thoſe things the Gentiles were bound to obſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Coppinger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If the Reaſon of a Law doth remain the ſame that it was before Chriſts death, the Law doth remain the ſame.</p>
               <p>But the reaſon of the ſeventh day ſabbath doth remain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Law for the ſeventh day ſabbath doth remain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I deny the Major: for that which you call the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40990:111"/>reaſon of a Law, may remain the ſame, when the Law doth not remain: and for this, I ſhall give you two inſtances, inſtead of many.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.11. there you ſhall find that the reaſon why God would have <hi>Iſrael</hi> to keep the ſeventh year for a ſabbath, in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hey ſhould not gather that which grew of its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>own accord, it was for the good of the poor, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat the poor of thy people might be refreſhed,</hi> Exod. 23. now a man may as well ſay, he muſt let his and lie every ſeventh year, becauſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on remains, <hi>viz.</hi> That he may refreſh the poor of his people: as he may ſay he muſt keep the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eventh day ſabbath, becauſe the reaſon of that Law is in force, which is, That his ſtranger and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervant, and cattle may be refreſhed.</p>
               <p>But further, there is another reaſon urged why we muſt keep the Law that commands he ſeventh day ſabbath, and that is (ſay you) becauſe we believe, as well as the Jews, that God made heaven and earth in ſix dayes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſted the ſeventh, therefore we as well as the Jews, muſt work ſix dayes, and keep the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or ſeventh day ſabbath: I ſay, this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence doth not follow; for the reaſon why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſrael was commanded to ſanctifie the prieſts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was, becauſe the Lord their God did ſanctifie them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.8. now though I do believe with Iſrael, that the Lord doth ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie me, yet I am not bound for this reaſon to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40990:112"/>ſanctifie the prieſts, the ſons of <hi>Aaron:</hi> thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you ſee by theſe two inſtances, that the reaſon of a Law may be the ſame, when the Law is not the ſame.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Coppinger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>As to your firſt inſtance, namely, that the ſeventh yeer was commanded for a Mora reaſon: I anſwer, This was not an univerſal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for the text faith, That <hi>the poor of THY peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may eat,</hi> which was not for all: and as to your ſecond inſtance, I confeſs the reaſon doth remain and is univerſal. <hi>viz.</hi> That God doth ſanctifie us; and therefore I ſay the Law remains, that we ſhould ſanctifie Gods Miniſters ſtill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>As for your Anſwer to my firſt inſtance, it doth ſignifie little: for I ſay refreſhing the poor is a moral and univerſal duty; and if than the ſeventh yeer of reſt was commanded for the benefit of their poor and cattle, then by your Argument, if the reaſon of this Law, (<hi>viz.</hi> that the poor ſhould be refreſhed) do remain then it muſt needs follow, by your Logick, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ſeventh yeer ſabbath muſt remain, as well as the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
               <p>And as touching your anſwer to my ſecond inſtance, I muſt tell you, that in your Anſwer you have confuted your ſelf; for you confeſs the reaſon of the Law remains, which was given to Iſrael for ſanctifying the prieſt.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:40990:112"/>
               <p>Secondly, you ſay that the Law remains that we muſt ſanctifie Gods Miniſters: then by your favour, if you can make the reaſon of the Law for ſanctifying the Prieſt, the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> a reaſon why you ſhould ſanctifie not the ſame but another Prieſthood, then I may make the reaſons for ſanctifying the ſeventh day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ſerve for the ſanctifying not the ſame but another day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Coppinger.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>So you may, if you can prove the aboliſhing of the ſeventh day ſabbath, as I can prove the aboliſhing the Levitical Prieſthood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ives.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Then you have confuted your ſelf again, and anſwered your own Argument: for your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, that where-ever the reaſon of a Law remains, there the Law remains; and you have confeſſed that the reaſon of the Law doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main why God would have <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſanctifie the Prieſt, the ſons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and now in your laſt anſwer tell me, That that Prieſthood is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed. So then, if I could never ſhew you that the ſeventh day ſabbath was aboliſhed, yet I have confuted your Argument, by ſhewing that the reaſon of a Law doth remain when the Law doth not remain, and you have confeſſed both; for you ſay that the reaſon why Iſrael was to ſanctifie that Prieſthood, is the ſame ſtill, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe God ſanctifies his people; and you
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40990:113"/>confeſſed the Law is not the ſame; for you ſay, The Prieſthood is aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, I have ſhewn you in the former Diſputation, that the ſeventh day ſabbath was aboliſhed as well as the Levitical Prieſthood; by an Argument which you could not anſwer, which I raiſed from that text <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. with which I ſhall conclude this Diſputation: <hi>Let no man therefore judge you in meats or in drinks, or in reſpect of a holy day, or of the new moons, or of the SABBATH days, which are ASHA. DOW of things to come: but the body is of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Thus having given a faithful account of all the Arguments and Anſwer that were inſiſted on in the ſeveral Diſputations, without omitting of any one text of Scripture, Argument or Anſwer, that was urged on either ſide; I ſhall leave the whole to the judgement of thoſe that are impartial, deſiring of God that it may anſwer the ends for which it is ſent forth into the world, which is the glory of Almighty GOD, and the eſtabliſhment of the Weak: which is all that is herein aymed at, by</p>

            <p>I Have annexed this inſuing Appendix, for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation fo the weak, and thoſe that are not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Laws and Terms of Diſputation; and it may alſo ſerve for the general uſe of all that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſatisfied in the preſent controverſie, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may not have leaſure or patience to read all the foregoing Arguments and Anſwers urged in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Diſputations: and herein I ſhall obſerve this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Firſt, I ſhall lay down all thoſe Arguments that I have ever met with, which are levied for the defence of the Saturday-Sabbath; with brief Anſwers thereunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall urge the Reaſons why I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Saturday-ſabbath is not in force to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhew ſome Reaſons for the juſtifying the preſent practiſe of the Chriſtians in their Religious obſervations of the firſt day of the week, otherwiſe called the Lords-day.</p>
            <p>And firſt, to the firſt, namely, the Arguments that are urged by ſome Judaizing Chriſtians for the defence of the ſeventh-day ſabbath; and they are of three ſorts: the firſt ſort are taken from the Scriptures, the ſecond from ſome Reaſons in Nature; and the third ſort of Reaſons are taken from Tradition.

Secondly, whereas it is ſaid this was ſpoken to <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore to all the world; I anſwer, that all that was commanded <hi>Adam</hi> did not bind all the world at all times, as appears by the commandment given to <hi>Adam to eat of the tree</hi> of life, <hi>Gen</hi> 2. and to forbear the tree of knowledge of good and evil; theſe Laws are not now binding to all the world, and yet they were given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to all men, had they continued in that eſtate.

But thirdly, theſe words, <hi>And God ſanctified the ſeventh-day,</hi> are urged by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. as a Reaſon why the Iſraelites in his time did keep the ſabbath, rather then to ſhew that God ſanctified the ſeventh-day for <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity in innocencie: my reaſons are, firſt, becauſe all the Patriarks from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> did not keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath, which was two thouſand yeers and upwards, and in all this long tract of time, not one word of the 7th-day ſabbath-keeping or breaking.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelf, a learned Jew, ſpeaking of this reſt, faith, That Gods reſting on the ſeventh day was the reaſon why the Iſraelites repoſed or reſted upon that day, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. Now had the Jews underſtood the ſeventh-day had been ſanctified before <hi>Moſes, Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> would have mentioned it in his Hiſtory of <hi>Amiquities</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as other things, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering the great occaſion which he had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Antiquity of the ſabbath, from the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that was caſt upon it by <hi>Appion</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who tells the Jews that their ſabbath was derived from the Egyptian word <hi>Sabbo,</hi> which ſignifieth a diſeaſe in the Privy parts, which (ſaith he) the Jews were ſmote with after they had travelled ſix days from <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereupon they were forced to reſt the ſeventh-day, and therefore called it a Sabbath from the name of the diſeaſe, which they called <hi>Sabbo.</hi> Now <hi>Joſephus</hi> could not have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Argument to have vindicated the Jews ſabbath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Appions</hi> foul aſperſions, but by ſhewing to the world that the ſabbath was kept from the Creation of the world unto that time, and not taken up by the Jews in the wilderneſs after they came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now though <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth vindicate the ſabbath from being derived of the Egyptian word <hi>Sabbo,</hi> by ſhewing that it was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Hebrew word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which ſignifieth reſt; yet he never vindicateth the Jews Sabbath from that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40990:116"/>other Allegation of <hi>Appions (viz.)</hi> that the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it was in the wilderneſs, after that Iſrael came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as any one may ſee that reads <hi>Joſephus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Appion, Lib.</hi> 2. which clearly ſhews, that the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was not kept before Iſrael came into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Scripture uſually ſpeaks at this rate; for there is ſuch a kind of expreſſion uſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in this very chapter <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.11. where he tells us of the river <hi>Piſon, that compaſſeth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold,</hi> &amp;c. not that this land was ſo called in <hi>Eden</hi> while <hi>Adam</hi> was in innocencie; for <hi>Havilah</hi> was not born till after the flood, by whoſe name this land was known and called; and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> by antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation calls it the land of <hi>Havilah,</hi> with reference unto that name which 1600 yeers afterwards it did receive: and that <hi>Havilah</hi> was not born till after the flood, appears <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.7. and that the flood was more then 1600 yeers after the Creation, appears not only by what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tell us, but by the conſent of Chriſtian writers: <hi>ſee Auguſt. de Civitate Dei, lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. and <hi>lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 12, 14. and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> calls a Country by this name in his deſcribing of the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe true, but with reſpect to what it was afterwards cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; in like manner <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>God ſanctified the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day,</hi> Gen. 2.3. which alſo refers to the Law that God gave to Iſrael by the hand of Moſes for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40990:116"/>of <hi>Sin;</hi> and the command for the Ark, and the making of the Tabernacle was not given till they came to <hi>Sinai, Exod,</hi> 25.10. at which time the Teſtimony was given to them, and yet mention is made of this before: ſo in like manner, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>That God did ſanctifie the ſeventh-day,</hi> he is to be underſtood in the ſame ſenſe, as the other Text is underſtood, where it is ſaid, <hi>Aaron laid up the Manna before the Teſtimony,</hi> which relates to what was afterwards done when the Law was given: even after the ſame manner doth <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. when he faith, <hi>God did ſanctifie the ſeventh-day;</hi> not that he did ſanctifie it in <hi>Eden,</hi> any more then <hi>Aaron</hi> laid up the Manna in the wilderneſs of <hi>Sin</hi> before the Teſtimony; but that he did ſanctifie it when he gave his Law to Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el: and this is further confirmed by what hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>(viz.)</hi> that from the Creation of the world to the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was above two thouſand yeers, there is not one word mentioned of the ſeventh-day ſabbath, though occaſionally there is mention made of all other moral duties.</p>

            <p>I anſwer, That this Law was given to none but Iſrael, as appears <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.19, 20. <hi>He hath given his Laws to Jacob, his ſtatues and judgments to Iſrael: be hath not done ſo to any Nation.</hi> Again, the Apoſtle tells us <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.

               <hi>I anſwer,</hi> They are bound to all the nine expreſly and particularly by the light of Nature, and the Law of Chriſt; but they are not ſo bound to the ſeventh-day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Again, that Law of the fourth Commandment
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40990:117"/>binds us as to A time to worſhip, though not that time of the ſeventh-day. But ſecondly, might not theſe men as well object this againſt the Apoſtle, who expreſly complains of the Gentiles for the breach of all the nine Commandments, but not a word that they did not keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath, as I ſhall ſhew by and by? which doubtleſs he would have had an occaſion to have done, had the ſeventh-day ſabbath-breaking been a breach of a Moral Law, as well as the other nine precepts.</p>

               <hi>Another Argument is taken from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Law given to Iſrael, which are, firſt, God gave this as a Reaſon why Iſrael ſhould reſt the ſeventh-day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſix days he made Heaven and Earth: therefore if this Reaſon be beleeved by Christian Gentiles, then this Law ſhould be obſerved by them</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, God commanded Iſrael to reſt the ſeventh-day, becauſe it was the ſabbath of the Lord their God: therefore if Jehovah be the Lord our God, his ſabbath muſt be our ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, God did command this duty for the good of our ſervants and cattle; therefore if we will ſhew mercy to them, we muſt keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer</hi> to the firſt, that the Reaſon of a Law may be univerſal, and always remain, when the Law doth not remain; as for inſtance, the Reaſon why God would have the people of Iſrael to ſanctifie the Prieſts the ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was, <hi>becauſe he was the Lord that did ſanctifie them,</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. 21. 8. Now I hope all Chriſtian Gentiles, beleeve that God doth ſanctifie them: but doth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that becauſe God doth ſanctifie beleeving Gentiles, that therefore they muſt ſanctifie a Levitical Prieſthood?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The place of Iſraels worſhip was called the houſe of the Lord God, doth it therefore follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Gentiles muſt therefore ſanctifie that place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is the God of the Gentiles? no more doth it follow, that becauſe the ſeventh-day was the ſabbath of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40990:117"/>the Lord, God, that therefore the beleeving Gentiles muſt obſerve it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whereas it is ſaid, we muſt reſt the ſeventh-day, that we may ſhew mercy to our ſervants and cattle: I anſwer, we can do that by reſting the firſt day of the week, as well as by reſting the ſeventh. Secondly, If becauſe that we muſt ſhew mercy, be a Reaſon why we ſhould keep the ſeventh-day ſabbath, becauſe Iſrael was to keep it for that Reaſon, then we muſt alſo drink deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this cup of Judaiſm, and keep the ſeventh-yeer ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, becauſe that was commanded for the benefit of the poor, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.11. <hi>That the poor of thy people may eat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So</hi> that the Reaſons of a Law may have a being, when the Law hath none; as appears by the Reaſon of the ſanctifying the Prieſt, it was, becauſe God ſanctifies the people; yet though we do beleeve that God doth ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, yet we are not therefore to ſanctifie the Legal Prieſthood: in like manner, though we do beleeve with <hi>Abraham, Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that God made Heaven and Earth in ſix days, and reſted the ſeventh, yet this is no Reaſon why we rather then they ſhould obſerve that day, any more, then why we ſhould obſerve the other Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws, whoſe Reaſons are ſtill the ſame, though the Laws are changed.</p>

               <hi>The next Arguments follow from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the New Teſtament, and they are ſuch as pretend to command and example; even as the former: I ſhall firſt ſpeak to thoſe Texts that are cited to prove that the ſeventh-day ſabbath was commanded in the New Teſtament: and the firſt is</hi> Mat. 5.17, 18. <hi>the words are theſe:</hi> Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil. For I ſay unto you, that till Heaven and Earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law till all be fulfilled. <hi>Whence it is inferred, that the ſeventh day ſabbath was a part of the Law, and therefore it ſhould remain as long as Heaven and Earth remain.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="218" facs="tcp:40990:118"/>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, that offering of ſacrifices is alſo a part of this Law; but doth it follow therefore that beleeving Gentiles muſt offer ſacrifices to the end of the world? and that offering of ſacrifices is a point of this Law, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 23 24. where our Lord as truly commands, that a man ſhould come and offer his gift upon the Altar, after he is reconciled to his brother, as he doth injoyn any other duty; the like he commands of the leper that was clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt ſaith the ſame thing of the Prophets as well as of the Law, that they ſhall not paſs away till they are fulfilled, and yet many of them were fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Chriſts time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſaith of his own words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.35. <hi>That Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but his word ſhall not paſs;</hi> and yet the 34 <hi>ver.</hi> ſaith, that, <hi>that Generation ſhould not paſs away till all thoſe things were fulfilled.</hi> The meaning then was clearly this, that rather then either the Law or his word ſhould paſs unfulfilled, Heaven and Earth ſhould paſs: which doth in no wiſe argue that all the Law and Prophets ſhould remain unfulfilled till the Heavens ſhould be no more; for the Text tells us, <hi>He came to fulfil the Law and Prophets:</hi> ſo that if all the Law and Prophets be unfulfilled, Chriſt did not anſwer the end of his coming; and if any be fulfilled, then ALL the Law muſt not laſt till the Heavens be no more; and if any be fulfilled, then the ſeventh-day ſabbath may be fulfilled, ſince the ſabbath is called <hi>a ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> Col. 2.16, 17. However, if any of that Law <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. be fulfilled by Chriſt, no man can conclude reaſonably from that Text, that the ſeventh-day ſabbath is in force.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Though all this Law <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. was in force be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts death, yet we are freed from the Law by the death of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.2, 3, 6. therefore no Argument can be drawn from this Text to prove the ſeventh-day ſabbath unleſs Chriſt or his apoſtles had reinforced the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40990:118"/>obſervation of it after his Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>6</label> 
               <hi>I come now to the ſixth Argument, and that is drawn from</hi> Mat. 24.20. ver. <hi>where Chriſt bids the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> pray, that their flight was not on the Sabbath day; <hi>whence it is inferred, that if Chriſt would not have had the ſabbath ſanctified after his Reſurrection, he would never have cautioned his Diſciples to pray, that their flight was not upon the ſeventh day ſabbath, which was a Propheſie to be fulfilled after the Reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that this proves no more that Chriſt would have the ſabbath ſanctified by the beleeving Gentiles, then it proves he would have the winter time ſanctified; for he likewiſe bids them pray, that they might not fly in the winter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the ſabbath had been in force, they might fly to ſave their lives on the ſabbath, and therefore that could not be the reaſon why they ſhould pray they might not fly upon the ſabbath: for if Chriſt a allowed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to walk through the corn-fields upon the ſabbath, and pluck the ears of corn to ſatisfie a little hunger, he would not (if the ſabbath had been in force) have judged it a breach of the ſabbath for them to fly to ſave their lives.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The reaſon why they were to pray that they might not fly on that day, was, becauſe the ſeditious Jews (as ſtories make mention) were ſo zealous of their ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, that if any for fear of an enemy ſhould have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fly to ſave his life upon the ſabbath, the Jews themſelves would have laid hands firſt upon him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt bids them pray, that they may not fly then. leſt they ſhould be in perils by their Countrymen, as well as by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſhould invade them: which perils of their own Countrymen they were not ſo likely to meet with in their flight upon another day.</p>

            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:40990:119"/>
            <p>I anſwer, That it was ordinary for the Jews days to be called after the death of Chriſt, by the old names they had before; as the Paſſeover is frequently ſo called by the Apoſtles, after thoſe things were aboliſhed, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.16. and ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Paul</hi> faith, <hi>be will tarry at Epheſus till Pentecoſt;</hi> ſo that Chriſts calling it by the name of the ſabbath day, doth no more prove it is in force, then <hi>Paul</hi>'s mentioning the feaſt of Pentecoſt, proves that we ought to obſerve the feaſt of, Pentecoſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, that theſe were not beleeving Gentiles, which are the ſubjects under debate. But ſecondly, the Law of the New Teſtament was not eſtabliſhed till Chriſts Reſurrection, when he faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>That all power in Heaven and Earth was given to him;</hi> therefore no marvel that theſe were found in their Old Teſtament obſervations. Thirdly, It was no eaſie matter to take off the zeal even of beleeving Jews themſelves from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> after Chriſt was aſcended: you ſee this in <hi>Peter,</hi> who was an eminent Apoſtle, yet he had ſo much Conſcience of the Law after the partition-wall was broken down, that he would not eat with the Gentiles, nor eat any thing which in the Law was common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.14.28. and ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20, 21. there were thouſands of Jews that did beleeve, that were zealous of the Commandments; doth it therefore follow that thoſe Commandments were in force? in like manner, it doth not follow, that becauſe theſe women kept the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath according to the command, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commandment for the ſabbath was to be in force to beleeving Gentiles after Chriſts Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If this were a good Argument, the Jewiſh
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40990:119"/>women kept the Sabbath according to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after Chriſt was dead, therefore the commandment is in force to beleeving Gentiles after his Reſurrection; would it not be as good an Argument, for a man to ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> being a Jew kept the Feaſt of Pentecoſt after Chriſt was riſen, therefore beleeving Gentiles might keep the Feaſt of Pentecoſt ſince Chriſt is riſen?</p>

               <hi>Chriſt faith,</hi> the ſabbath was made for man, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.27. <hi>which is to be underſtood of every man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a Law binding to beleeving Gentiles.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, This could not be the ſeventh day reſt, becauſe it is a reſt only provided for beleevers to enter into; but unbeleevers might enter into the ſeventh day reſt, and ſo might their cattle alſo: therefore unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers did not, nor could not enter into this reſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Let us therefore labour to enter into that reſt, lest any man fall after the ſame example of unbeleef.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whereas it is ſaid, that the Author alludeth to the ſeventh day reſt, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>God reſted the ſeventh day,</hi> ver. 4. I anſwer, This Text doth no more prove that the Gentiles are commanded to obſerve that time of reſt, becauſe the Author alludeth to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, then it proves they were to obſerve that place or reſt, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe he alludeth to that place <hi>v</hi> 8. <hi>For if Joſhua had given them reſt, he would not after wards have ſpoken of another day;</hi> by which words the Author doth as truly allude to the place of reſt that <hi>Joſhua</hi> conducted Iſrael to in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the time of reſt, that God reſted on; and therefore this cleerly proves that both were typical; for <hi>Joſhua</hi> did give them the reſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and a reſt upon the ſeventh day, and yet he propheſies of another reſt, and another day; which clearly proves, this was neither the time of reſt, nor the place of reſt that <hi>Iſrael</hi> did enjoy,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40990:120"/>that the Author means; but that place of reſt and time of reſt, which under the Goſpel the beleevers have in hope, and which after all their labours and travels they ſhall at laſt have in hand, and reſt from all ſorrow and labour (when that great ſabbath ſhall commence) as God did from his labour, when he had ended his work of Creation. To this agrees <hi>Mat.</hi> 11 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and I will give you reſt: and Revel.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth faith the Spirit, that they MAY reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them.</hi>

               <hi>I proceed to the next Text of Scripture, which is much inſiſted on to prove the ſeventh day ſabbath is in force to beleeving Gentiles by a Commandment, and that is</hi> Jam. 2.8, 10. <hi>where the whole Law is required, and where it is ſaid, we ſhould not offend in one point; therefore the ſeventh day ſabbath being a part and a point of the whole Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Gentiles are bound to obſerve it: to this is added thoſe words of</hi> Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> To which I anſwer, firſt, that this word <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>whole Law,</hi> is variouſly taken in holy Scriptures; and therefore it is not ſafe to conclude the ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath from ſuch Texts, leſt we are forced at laſt to do as ſome did, who ſome years ſince began to profeſſe the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Sabbath, becauſe it was a part of the Law, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came by the force of the ſame reaſon to keep all the Jewiſh Ceremonies, becauſe they were parts of the whole Law, and at laſt went over Sea and turned Jews, and denied the Lord Chriſt to be the true Meſſiah. And that the word <hi>Law</hi> is variouſly taken, nothing is more manifeſt; for there is a Law of <hi>Moſes, Mal.</hi> 4.4. and <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. there is a Law of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. there is the Law of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. there is the Law of Works, and the Law of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. there is the Law of Bondage, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. and there is a Law of Liberty, <hi>James</hi> 1.25. and <hi>James</hi> 3.12. <hi>So ſpeak and ſo de, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of LIBERTY.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="224" facs="tcp:40990:121"/>
            <p>Now the great Queſtion will be, which of theſe Laws <hi>James</hi> means, when he tells us, <hi>We muſt keep the whole law?</hi> if he means, the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then we muſt, as I have ſaid, obſerve Circumciſion, becauſe the Jews did Circumciſe, that the Law of MOSES might not be broken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.23. and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. <hi>That be that was circumciſed was bound to keep the WHOLE Law;</hi> ſo that to underſtand this Text to be meant of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, will neceſſarily introduce all Judaiſm; but if we ſhould underſtand it (as indeed we ought) for the Law of Liberty, and the Law of Faith, which is the Law that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of in this Chapter, and that <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſpeak of, when he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. <hi>He doth eſtabliſh the Law:</hi> I ſay, if we underſtand the word <hi>Law in this later fence</hi> for the Law of Chriſt, the Law of Faith, and the Law of Liberty; I demand where any of theſe Laws do command a ſeventh day ſabbath? So that what ever the Law of Chriſt, and the Law of Faith and Liberty, and the Law of Nature do injoyn us to obſerve, theſe we muſt obſerve in every point, or we ſhall be guilty of all, if we wilfully break the leaſt Command required in theſe Laws, which in no place commands a ſeventh-day ſabbath: and that <hi>James</hi> means the Law of Liberty, the ſecond Chapter 12 Verſe will inform us. For when he had in the 10 Verſe told them, that <hi>be that ſinned in one point of the Law was guilty of all;</hi> he tells them in the 12 Verſe what Law he means, and therefore bids <hi>ſo do, as thoſe that ſhould be judged by the Law of Liberty:</hi> ſo that unleſs any body can prove, that the Law of Liberty doth command a ſeventh day ſabbath, they cannot prove, from this Text, that the believing Gentiles are bound to obſerve it any more then they are bound to obſerve all the Jewiſh rudiments; the obſervation whereof, experience tells us is the ſad and evil conſequence of this opinion.</p>

               <hi>The eleventh Argument to prove the ſeventh day ſabbath, is more general then the former,</hi> viz <hi>Becauſe all Laws that were never repealed are in force; therefore the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40990:121"/>ſeventh day ſabbath is in force by a Law, becauſe it was once commanded and never repealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer,</hi> if by the not repealing of a Law, they do mean that which is not expreſly and particularly repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then we muſt keep the Paſſover; for that was once a Law, and was never repealed expreſly and particularly.</p>
            <p>Again, we muſt keep the year of Jubilee, for that was once a Law, and it was never expreſly and particularly repealed. Furthermore, by this Argument we muſt keep the ſeventh yeer for a ſabbath, and neither plow or ſow our fields, or do any work for that whole yeer, becauſe it was once commanded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. and it was never expreſly and particularly repealed: but doth it therefore follow that we are bound to obſerve theſe things? in like manner it doth not follow that the ſeventh day ſabbath muſt be ſtill obſerved, becauſe it was once commanded, and in ſo many words was never repealed.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, The ſeventh day ſabbath is repealed in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. where it is called, <hi>A ſhadow of things to come.</hi>

               <hi>We come now to thoſe Texts that are urged for Examples; and they are thoſe that tell us, that be Apoſtle</hi> preached in the Synagogue every SABBATH-day, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.14, 42. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.12, 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Whence it is inferred, that we ought to walk as we have them for an Example; therefore if they kept the ſeventh day ſabbath, we muſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Then we muſt meet in a Jewiſh Synagogue as well as the Apoſtles did every ſabbath day: if they muſt be our Examples for A TIME of worſhip, they muſt be ſo for a PLACE of worſhip; for ſuch places were as well commanded as ſuch times.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> muſt we therefore circumciſe?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did obſerve the Law of the <hi>Nazarites, Act.</hi> 21. muſt we therefore obſerve it?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>He muſt needs keep the feaſt of the Paſſeover,</hi> Act. 18, 21. Doth it therefore follow that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40990:122"/>we muſt keep the feaſt of the Paſſeover? and yet after this manner do theſe men reaſon, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that they muſt keep the ſeventh day ſabbath, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> kept it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Text doth not ſay <hi>Paul</hi> did keep the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, any more then it faith, he did reverence the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary; but that having the opportunity of theſe times and places in which the Jews were aſſembled, he made uſe thereof to preach Chriſt unto them.</p>

               <hi>Having urged and anſwered thoſe Arguments taken from commands and Examples out of the Old and New Teſtament, I come now to thoſe Arguments that plead the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbaths Morality, from Natural Reaſons: and the firſt is, That the ſeventh-day ſabbath muſt needs be moral, becauſe (as</hi> Mr. Spittlehouſe <hi>told me before many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) that the ſeven Stars did preach the ſeventh day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and therefore the Heathen kept the Saturday, which is ſo called of</hi> Saturn <hi>the ſeventh Planet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, that firſt, this is vain Philoſophy indeed.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Mr. <hi>Spittlehouſe</hi> is an ignorant Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and a more ignorant Aſtrologer, in ſaying, that <hi>Saturn</hi> is the ſeventh Planet, which all writers in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy and Aſtrology do declare to be the firſt Planet, and accordingly ſo place it and call it; and therefore the Heathen rather kept Saturday as the firſt day then the ſeventh day, becauſe <hi>Saturn</hi> is the firſt of all the ſeven Planets.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, The Heathen did keep every ninth day to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> doth it therefore follow that theſe were ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths that God required? Again, <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> that the <hi>Athenians</hi> offered to him their greateſt ſacrifices upon the eighth day of <hi>October,</hi> becauſe of his arrival that day from <hi>Cret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> and they did keep the eighth day of every month becauſe he was derived of <hi>Neptune:</hi> and therefore <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew puts this difference between Jews and Gentiles <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Jews kept a day eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry week, but the Gentiles did but keep one in a moneth; by which it appears, that the ſeventh day of the week
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40990:122"/>was not more honoured by the Heathen, then the ninth day of the week, or the eighth day of the month, on which they offered their greateſt ſacrifices.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, If it were lawful thus to trifle, might not a man as well prove Sunday, or the firſt day of the week to be a ſabbath, according to the light of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Heathen worſhipped the Sun, as any body can prove Saturday to be a ſabbath, becauſe the Heathen worſhipped the Planet <hi>Saturn?</hi> but enough, if not more then enough of this vain reaſoning.</p>
            <p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>13</label> 
               <hi>The thirteenth Argument is taken from the morality and perfection of the number ſeven; that it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect number, and therefore when the ſeventh day comes we muſt reſt: for the proof of this notion, they cite Scriptures that magnifie the number ſeven, as</hi> Davids <hi>praying</hi> ſeven times a day, <hi>and Chriſts caſting</hi> ſeven Devils <hi>out of</hi> Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delene; <hi>and</hi> ſeven yeers of plenty, <hi>and ſeven yeers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in Egypt, <hi>amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I anſwer, that one would think theſe men had ſuffered 7 yeers famine in a want of Arguments for their opinion of the ſeventh day, or elſe they would never catch at ſuch things as theſe; but I remember <hi>Solomon</hi> faith, <hi>to the hungry every bitter thing is ſweet;</hi> therefore if theſe men were not languiſhing for want of Arguments, they would never feed themſelves with ſuch vain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. For may not the Papiſts plead this Argument for their ſeven Sacraments, as well as theſe men can plead it for the ſeventh day ſabbath?</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Are not other numbers both in Nature, ſacred and prophane writings, as much ſet by as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeven? as <hi>God made two lights,</hi> Gen. 1.16. and he made man two eyes, two feet, two hands, and two ears; ſo there was two tables of the Law, and two Nations in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi>'s womb, and two Teſtaments; the like enum erati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be found of other numbers both in ſacred and prophane writing: but this kind of arguing is more like <hi>Cornelius Agrippa's</hi> Occulr Philoſophy, then Chriſtian Divinity.</p>

               <hi>The fourteenth, and laſt Argument is taken from the practiſe of the Church, the three firſt Centuries after Chriſt; whence they infer, that if the Chriſtians ſo long after kept the ſeventh day, it is a ſign that it was given them in charge by Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that the Chriſtian Churches kept the feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> 300 years after Chriſt, doth this follow therefore that Chriſt gave the keeping of <hi>Eaſter</hi> in charge to them? and that the Churches 300 years after Chriſt were zealous of <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, is very obvious to all that have any acquaintance with the ſtories of thoſe times: ſee <hi>Euſeb.</hi> lib. 5. cap. 21.22, 23, 24. and herein were the Chriſtians divided; the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches kept it at the ſame time the <hi>Jews</hi> kept their paſſeover, and, the Weſt Churches kept it upon ſome Sunday following after: in like manner were they divided about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of their weekly dayes; the <hi>Ebionites</hi> (ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi>) were a fort of Hereticks that were zealous of the Law, and did own the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but denied the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> for that he ſpake againſt the Law; thoſe did keep the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeventh day with other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law, and celebrate the Sundays in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſts Reſurrection, as other Chriſtians do, <hi>lib</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. The like ſaith <hi>Epiphanius, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Haereſ. 3c.</hi> thus we ſee how the Chriſtians were divided in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe about the weekly and yearly obſervation of dayes, that we may as eaſily prove Chriſt left the feaſt of the Paſſeover in charge to the Chriſtian world, as that he left the ſeventh day in charge, becauſe as the one was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo was the other, for more then 300 years after Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having anſwered the Arguments levied for the Jews Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; I ſhall now urge reaſons why the Jews Sabbath, or the ſeventh day Sabbath is not of force to be believing Gentiles in the times of the Goſpel, either by the Law of nature,</hi> Moſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>1</label> Firſt, the Gentiles are not commanded by the Law of Nature, becauſe nature doth never convince
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40990:123"/>any of ſin for not keeping the ſeventh day Sabbath, and yet it did convince the Gentiles of ſin for not keeping the other nine Commandments: now had the Sabbath been a moral Law, or a Law in nature, then would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as well have reproved her children for the profaning of it, as it hath reproved them for the breach of all the reſt: and that nature hath reproved every man for the breach of all other laws, which are moral, appears, if we view <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. The Gentiles, who had not the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> broke the firſt Commandment, in that they <hi>worſhipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the Creature MORE then the Creator,</hi> Rom. 1.25. which was againſt the firſt Commandment, that faith, <hi>We muſt have no other Gods bus one.</hi> They broke the ſecond Commandment, in that they did change the glory of the incorruptible God into an IMAGE, made like corruptible man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.23. They broke the third Commandment, in that they blaſphemed the name of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. But no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their breach of the fourth Commandment. They broke the fifth Commandment, in that they were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Parents, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. They broke the ſixth commandment, in that they were guilty of murder, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. They broke the ſeventh Commandment, in that they were guilty of fornication and unlawfull luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26, 29. They broke the eighth Commandment, therefore the Apoſtle admoniſheth the converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17, 28. that <hi>they which had ſtolen ſhould ſteal no more;</hi> ſhewing that in the dayes of their Gentile vanities they walked not according to the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Again, they broke the ninth Commandment, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>without natural affection, truce-breakers, FALSE accuſers.</hi> They brake the tenth Commandment, in that they were guilty of covetouſneſſe, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.2. How often are the Gentiles charged with theſe ſins, both in the Old and New Teſtament, and yet they are never charged by the Law of Nature for ſeventh day Sabbath break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? and therefore <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us that the Mations did imitate, and learned to keep a Sabbath of the <hi>Jews:</hi> for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40990:124"/>(ſaith he) our cuſtome hath ſpread it ſelf among the Nations, &amp;c. clearly proving that the light of Nature never taught the Gentiles to keep the ſeventh day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contr. Appion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſecondly, the Gentiles could not keep the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day by the light of Nature, becauſe they are not exactly able to compute the ſeventh day from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon that the Sun ſtood ſtill in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time, and haſted not to go down for a whole day; and likewiſe the Sun went backwards ten degrees in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, which was almoſt half a day: by reaſon whereof, the light of Nature was never able to make a perfect account of the ſeventh day from the Creation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a man cannot know the ſeventh day from the fourth, but by tradition; therefore the knowledge of the ſeventh day is not moral; as for inſtance: Suppoſe a man ſick of a violent diſtemper that bereaveth him of his ſences, when he comes to his former underſtanding he will know his duty touching all the nine precepts, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo touching the ſetting apart ſome time to ſerve God; but as touching this ſeventh day, he cannot know this, but by the help of tradition, having loſt his account in the time of his ſickneſs: which ſhews that the ſeventh day is not commanded by the light of Nature, becauſe by that light a man cannot know the ſeenth day from the fourth or eighth.</p>
            <p>Again, this Reaſon is further illuſtrated by the Travels of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> who loſt a whole day, and ſo did all their company, before their return for <hi>England:</hi> ſo the Dutch in their Weſtern Diſcoveries, by reaſon of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Longitudes and Latitudes, they had loſt a day before they returned; which they had never been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in, but by the help of tradition: which ſhews that Nature could not inſtruct the Gentiles in the knowledge of a ſeventh day. Now theſe and the like caſes puts an abſolute neceſſity upon the world to be ignorant of this Law; therefore it cannot be moral.</p>
            <pb n="231" facs="tcp:40990:124"/>
            <p>The ſecond Argument which I urge to prove that the ſeventh day ſabbath is not in force to the believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, is, Becauſe they are not commanded by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law to keep the ſeventh day ſabbath.</p>
            <p>My Reaſons are, firſt, becauſe this Law was not given to any Nation but Iſrael: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>the Gentiles had not the Law,</hi> &amp;c</p>
            <p>Secondly, if <hi>Moſes</hi> Law be in force, then the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to the breach of the ſeventh day ſabbath is in force; which was, That the Congregation ſhould ſtone the Oftender to death, <hi>Num.</hi> 15.35. which I have ſhewn in the forementioned Diſputations cannot reaſonably be imagined to conſiſt with Goſpel-liberty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if <hi>Moſes</hi> Law be in force to require any thing of the Gentiles that is not expreſly and particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, then we may, by the Argument of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, take a liberty to innovate what Judaical Ceremonies we ſhall at any time have a mind unto.</p>

            <p>Firſt, becauſe he hath not expreſly required any ſuch thing in all the New Teſtament, nor have any of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to whom he delegated a power to preach the Laws of the New Teſtament, ever declared any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, the Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>the ſabbath was a ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> Col. 2.16, 27. Which muſt needs be underſtood of ſabbath days, as our Tranſlators have rendered it:</p>
            <p>Firſt, where-ever the word <hi>ſabbaths</hi> is otherwiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the Holy Ghoſt, for the help of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adds either that it is a ſabbath for the LAND, when he means yearly ſabbaths; or elſe if they were feſtival ſabbaths, he refers us to the Feaſts which-ought to be ſo ſanctified.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, where-ever <hi>ſabbath</hi> is joyned with <hi>new
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40990:125"/>moons</hi> and <hi>feaſts,</hi> there it is always underſtood of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath days, becauſe all their other ſabbaths were included in their feaſts, except the ſeventh day ſabbath: See for this purpoſe <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.3, 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.17. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.13.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſabbath day was called a ſigne by <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 31.17.</p>
            <p>Again, my third Reaſon why Chriſt hath not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the believing Gentiles to keep the ſeventh day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is, Becauſe the Apoſtle calls all the times that the Jews obſerved in the Law, <hi>weak and beggerly elements,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which the ſeventh day ſabbath was accounted: ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11. Now the Jews days were their weekly Sabbaths, their moneths were their new Moons, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.11. <hi>Num.</hi> 10.10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.12. their times were three in the years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.14, 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. from the firſt to the fourth was the feaſt of the Paſſover; from the ninth verſe to the thirteenth is mention made of the feaſt of harveſt, or feaſt of weeks; and from the thirteenth verſe to the 26, you may read of the feaſt of boothes or tabernacles; which were their times that they obſerved: Then they obſerved years, which ſhews that this was ſpoken of the Jews ſince, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> faith, No Nation waſted whole years as the Jews did: and that they were by the Law to keep years as well as days, and moneths and times, appears by the text, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. where every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeventh year, and every year of Jubilee, was commanded to be obſerved. Now if they had no time which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but days, moneths, times and years, and all theſe were weak and beggerly Rudiments, then it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that their ſeventh day ſabbaths are weak and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly. This reaſon remains good, till ſome body ſhall ſhew me that the ſeventh day ſabbath was not included in theſe words, <hi>days, moneths, times and years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My laſt R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſon why Chriſt never commánded the gentiles to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſerve the ſeventh day ſabbath, is becauſe the Apoſtle gives a toleration to the Chriſtians to keep every
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40990:125"/>day, as they are perſwaded in their own minds, either to <hi>eſteem one day above another, or every day alike,</hi> Rom. 14.5. which liberty he could not have given them, if Chriſt had confirmed the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the beleeving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. But this Argument did meet with two Objections; the one was, that this could not be underſtood of every day according to the letter of the Text; becauſe the Apoſtle gives a toleration to eat all things, and yet the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. forbiddeth the <hi>eating of blood, and things ſtrangled,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In like manner (ſay they) muſt we reſtrain the words <hi>every day,</hi> to be underſtood of every day but the ſabbath.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that the Holy Ghoſt hath put a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction upon the word <hi>every thing;</hi> but neither Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt, nor the Apoſtle hath put a reſtriction upon this word <hi>every day:</hi> therefore no mortal man ought to take that liberty to reſtrain the words of a Text, when the Holy Spirit doth not reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing Objected againſt this Argument, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. is this, <hi>(viz.) That if we are at liberty, and under no reſtraint, but may keep every day alike, then there is no reaſon to obſerve any day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwer to this Objection maketh way for the laſt thing intended, which is to ſhew, that though Chriſt hath ſet us at liberty from thoſe Moſaical Inſtitutions for the obſervation of days, and hath made all days alike in reſpect of any Moſaical ſanctity; yet it doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that we may ſpend every day to the ſervice of the fleſh, and chuſe whether we will ſet apart any time to the ſervice of God, as I have already hinted, <hi>page</hi> 90.</p>
            <p>For firſt, God hath freed us from that place of worſhip by the death of Chriſt, unto which both Jews and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes were enjoyned to come up to worſhip, which was in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and now Chriſt hath made every place alike, in that one place hath no more Legal or Moſaical ſanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty then another; doth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Chriſtians may abuſe this liberty, and chuſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40990:126"/>whether they will meet to worſhip God in any place or no? No more doth it follow, that becauſe Chriſt hath made all days alike in reſpect of any Moſaical ſanctity, that therefore we may chuſe whether we will keep any day at all.</p>
            <p>Again, ſecondly, Chriſt hath ſet us free from thoſe Moſaical Laws which God made for the maintenance of the Levitical Prieſthood and Legal Miniſtry, and hath not injoyned us how much or how little the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould be allowed; doth it therefore follow, that we may chuſe whether we will allow them any thing or nothing? In like manner, it doth not follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath taken away the Moſaical inſtitution for the obſervation of days, that therefore we may chuſe whether we will obſerve any day, or any time for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>But to this it is objected, <hi>That though Chriſt hath taken away that kind of maintenance, yet he hath ordained, that</hi> they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1.</p>
            <p>I anſwer in like manner, that though he hath taken away thoſe Moſaical obſervations of days and times, yet we are under a command to obſerve A time to worſhip, as well as A maintenance for Miniſters: my Reaſons are, firſt, becauſe the light of Nature hath taught all people to ſet apart ſome time to worſhip and ſerve their God: for if the light of Nature doth injoyn men to worſhip, it doth alſo injoyn them to obſerve ſome time in which they ought to worſhip. After this manner the Apoſtle argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the forecited Scripture, for the maintenance of the Goſpel-Miniſtery; ſhewing that the light of Nature teacheth, <hi>That they which plant a vineyard ought to eat of the fruit thereof; and that they which plow, ſhould plow in hope, to be pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>takers of their hope:</hi> the like reaſon (if not much greater) he urgeth, why they <hi>that ſow ſpiritual things, ſhould partake of temporal things:</hi> ſo that though God hath freed us from that maintenance of Miniſters, and that place of worſhip that was commanded in the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40990:126"/>Law, yet there remains a moral obligation upon us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome place to worſhip God in, and alſo to provide a competent maintenance for thoſe that adminiſter ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things unto us. In like manner there remains a Moral obligation upon us to obſerve A time to worſhip God, though we are freed from all thoſe days and times that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded his Diſciples to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>But 2. This doth not only appear from the light of Nature, but from the Scriptures alſo, which command, <hi>That we ſhould not forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the manner of ſome is,</hi> Heb. 10.25. Now if we muſt frequent the Aſſemblies of Gods people, then we muſt obſerve A time to worſhip, or elſe we cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the duty that is here injoyned; for, if we may chuſe whether we will obſerve any time of worſhip (as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection vainly ſuppoſeth) then we cannot perform this duty: of <hi>frequenting the Aſſemblies of the Saints,</hi> which appears was a duty not only commanded, but practiſed in the New Teſtament, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. in all which Texts we are informed of the whole Churches meeting together in one place, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they were required; which they could not have done, had they not agreed upon the place where, and a time when to meet together: ſo that if Chriſtians muſt meet together to worſhip God, they muſt alſo obſerve a time in order thereunto.</p>
            <p>And as I have ſhewn that A time and place ought to be obſerved for Gods worſhip; I ſhall in the laſt place ſhew, that the firſt day of the week ought rather to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved then any other day; and that, becauſe the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt have injoyned us to obſerve that time for publick worſhip, therfore that time ought rather to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved then another; for we are bound to hear the Church of Chriſt in all things that ſhe commands us to obſerve, provided, that the Church doth command nothing contrary to the commands of Chriſt: now that the Church doth not command any thing contrary &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, in commanding us to obſerve the firſt
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40990:127"/>day of the week, appears, becauſe Chriſt hath not left us any one day or time in charge, rather then another; no more then he hath left any place of worſhip in charge, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then another: and therefore the Church doth do nothing derogatory to the mind of Chriſt, in appointing a time of worſhip, no more then ſhe doth in appointing a place of worſhip: and that Chriſt hath not left us a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to obſerve one day rather then another, appears by that forecited text <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. &amp; therefore in all caſes Chriſt hath given power to his Church to make laws, as appears, in that he hath given them power to appoint the place where the Church ſhould aſſemble: would it not then be ſinful for any ſmall inconſiderable number of the Church to appoint another place to meet in, contrary to that which the whole church to which they are related have agreed to, and choſen to meet in? Even ſo in like manner will the Lord judge thoſe men guilty of Schiſm that ſhall rent from the Churches to which they are related, for no other cauſe but that they may keep a day in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that day appointed by the Church for the exerciſe of Religion. Now unleſs theſe men can prove by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs text that Chriſt hath given us a command to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſeventh day ſabbath; how will they eſcape the ſentence of refuſing to hear the Church, and that other ſentence of making diviſions contrary to the Doctrine which they have received? For in this caſe I ſhall appeal to the Conſciences of all thoſe men that keep the ſeventh day ſabbath, whether or no, if they ſhould agree upon a certain place to worſhip god, in yet if after this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome few of the Church ſhould at the ſame time in which their Church is aſſembled, refuſe to come to them, and meet in another place, where they liſt themſelves, would they not judge thoſe men guilty of ſchiſm and diſorder? now by what Law can they do it (ſince Chriſt hath appoint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d no particular place of meeting) but by the forementioned law, that the Church ought to be heard in all lawful thing, and therefore no private perſons
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40990:127"/>ought to contend againſt the Commands of the Church, when ſhe commands nothing contrary to ſound Doctrine? Now then, ſince a time to worſhip is to be obſerved, we remain bound in conſcience to obſerve that day which the Church of Chriſt commands us to obſerve, which is the firſt day of the week, till any body can ſhew us where Chriſt hath commanded another day: How then will thoſe men excuſe themſelves from rending and tearing the body of Chriſt aſunder, tht rent from the Churches whereunto they were formerly related, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but for that the Church obſerveth the firſt day of the week, and refuſeth to obſerve the Moſaical or Jewiſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſabbath? Let me therefore from what hath been ſaid, beſeeoh all that love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity, to tender the peace of the Church, and prefer the peace and proſperity thereof above their chief joy; and rather let their tongue cleave to the roof of their mouth, and their right hand forget its cunning, rather then let their hearts forget the peace and proſperity of the Church, whom Chriſt hath purchaſed with his own bloud; and let not theſe Diſputations about a ſabbath day, eat out of our memories the great ſabbath of the Lord that is approaching, in which every one that keeps Faith and a good Conſcience ſhall reſt with Chriſt from all their Labourings and Sufferings in this World, as GOD did from his Labour when he made the World. Oh then! let us all labour and ſtrive to enter into that reſt into which Chriſt is entred; and let us take heed that while we are labouring to enter into that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day reſt with the unbeleeving Jews, that together with them we fall not into the ſame example of unbeleef, in denying Jeſus Chriſt to be our only Lord and Saviour: into which unbeleef and diſobedience many have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fallen in theſe days, who while they have been labouring to intangle others with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
